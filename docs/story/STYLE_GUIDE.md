# Gemini Fantasy — Story Style Guide

The single source of truth for all narrative writing in this project. Every writer agent MUST read this before writing anything.

---

## Game Overview

**Gemini Fantasy** is a 2D JRPG with a 25-hour main story (20-30 hours with side content). It follows **Kael Voss**, an Echo Hunter who discovers a Conscious Echo named Lyra and gets pulled into a conflict between two factions racing to control humanity's collective consciousness.

**Tone**: Bittersweet hope. The world is broken but beautiful. Characters carry trauma but find moments of genuine joy. The humor is character-driven and earned, not quippy Marvel-style banter.

**Inspirations**: Chrono Trigger (tight pacing, every character matters), Final Fantasy VI (ensemble cast, earned apocalypse), Xenogears (philosophical depth without pretension), Persona 5 (character voices, mundane moments), Disco Elysium (internal monologue, moral complexity).

## The Golden Rules

### 1. Characters Are People, Not Archetypes

Every character was a person before they were a party member. They have bad habits, contradictions, and opinions about soup. Kael isn't "the protagonist" — they're a 24-year-old who collects dead people's memories and makes bad jokes when they're scared.

### 2. Dialogue Is Not Narration With Quotation Marks

Real people:
- Interrupt each other
- Don't finish sentences
- Say "um" and "well" and "look"
- Change the subject when uncomfortable
- Repeat themselves when emotional
- Use slang from their region
- Have verbal tics and pet phrases

### 3. Every Scene Earns Its Place

If you can cut a scene and the story still works, cut it. If a scene only does one thing (advance plot OR develop character OR build world), it needs to do more or be cut.

### 4. Show The Seams

The best JRPGs let you see the human hand behind them. Imperfect moments — an awkward confession, a joke that lands wrong, a plan that fails hilariously — these are what make stories feel real. Don't polish away the rough edges.

### 5. Silence Is A Tool

Some of the most powerful moments in JRPG history are wordless. Celes on the cliff. Crono's death. The opera scene before anyone sings. Use silence, pauses, and purely visual/action beats.

## Character Voice Reference

### Speech Pattern Cheat Sheet

| Character | Sentence Length | Vocabulary | Verbal Tics | Emotional Tell |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Kael | Medium, trailing | Casual, curious | Questions, "I mean...", trailing off | Gets quieter when scared |
| Iris | Short, clipped | Technical, military | Swearing, counting exits | Prosthetic hand clenches |
| Garrick | Very short | Simple, metaphorical | "..." (long pauses), fire/ash metaphors | Goes completely still |
| Nyx | Variable, blunt | Literal, innocent | Unsettling questions, "Is that...?" | Eyes change (starfield brightens/dims) |
| Sienna | Long, precise | Academic, clinical | Self-corrections, statistics | Hands shake more |
| Cipher | Fast, choppy | Tech jargon, slang | Counting threats, tech metaphors | Talks faster when scared |
| Lyra | Medium, wistful | Educated, archaic-tinged | Past tense, "I remember...", "Before..." | Becomes more translucent |
| Ash | N/A (nonverbal) | N/A | Gestures, tugging sleeves, pointing | Eye color shifts rapidly |
| Vex | Measured, corporate | Business, euphemisms | "We", strategic flattery | Mask slips re: Sienna |
| Prophet Null | Sermonizing, plural | Religious, collective | "The faithful...", speaking for many | Reveals crystal form |

### Regional Slang to Use

**Verdant Tangle** (Kael's home):
- "Overgrown" = complicated
- "Root deep" = traditional, stubbornly held
- "Memory bloom" = nostalgia, bittersweet remembering

**Ironcoast Federation** (Iris, Cipher, Sienna's origin):
- "Crystal clear" = understood
- "Hollow" = insult meaning emotionless/soulless
- "Echoing" = repeating yourself pointlessly

**Cindral Wastes** (Garrick's origin):
- "Ash walker" = survivor, compliment
- "Ember heart" = passionate person
- "Cooled" = given up, defeated

**Crystalline Steppes**:
- "Trade fair" = honest, good deal
- "Nomad's path" = uncertain future
- "Crystal blessed" = lucky

## Anti-Pattern Catalog

### Words and Phrases BANNED From All Writing

These are markers of generic AI-generated prose. Using them will make the story feel artificial.

**Banned narrative phrases:**
- "little did they know"
- "a tapestry of"
- "resonated deeply" (especially ironic for this game)
- "in that moment"
- "the weight of [abstract noun]" (e.g., "the weight of responsibility")
- "a sense of [emotion]" — just SHOW the emotion
- "it's worth noting"
- "spoke volumes"
- "a testament to"
- "couldn't help but"
- "steeled themselves"
- "exchanged a knowing glance"
- "the air was thick with [emotion]"
- "broke the silence"
- "nodded solemnly"
- "clenched their fists" (find a different physical tell)
- "let out a breath they didn't know they were holding"

**Banned dialogue patterns:**
- "I must confess..."
- "Indeed" / "Precisely" / "Fascinating"
- "You see..." (as exposition opener)
- "As you know..." (expository dialogue)
- "We need to talk" (find a less cliché way in)
- "I have a bad feeling about this"
- "It's not what it looks like"
- "You don't understand!"
- Characters explaining their emotions: "I'm angry because..."
- Characters giving long philosophical monologues unprompted

**Banned structural patterns:**
- Starting consecutive paragraphs with the same word
- Every character reacting to news in sequence ("I can't believe it" / "This changes everything" / "What do we do now?")
- Convenient eavesdropping as a plot device
- Characters arriving "just in time"
- Dream sequences that are obviously dreams
- Flashbacks triggered by staring at objects

### What To Do Instead

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "The air was thick with tension" | Describe a specific detail: "Nobody was eating. Garrick's spoon hadn't moved in five minutes." |
| "She felt a wave of grief" | Show it: "Iris's hand found the dog tags in her pocket. Her thumb traced the letters." |
| "He explained the situation" | Put it in character: "Garrick laid out the facts like stones on a grave. One by one. No extras." |
| Philosophical monologue | Interrupted dialogue: "It's about whether we have the right to—" "Kael." "What?" "You're doing the thing again." |
| Villain explains plan | Show the consequences: "The cell was full of people who used to be people. Sienna recognized subject 17." |
| Character announces growth | Quiet action: "Cipher held the door open for the others. Didn't even count the exits first." |

## Formatting Rules

### Script Format

```markdown
## Scene X: Title

**Location**: Specific place
**Party**: Who is present (order matters — first listed is most prominent)
**Time**: Time of day, weather, atmosphere
**Gameplay Context**: What the player was doing / will do
**Estimated Duration**: X minutes

### Setting

[2-3 sentences. Specific. What do we see, hear, smell?]

### [Beat Name]

*[Stage direction — character actions, camera movement suggestions]*

**KAEL**: Dialogue line here.

**IRIS**: Response.

*[More stage direction]*

**KAEL**: Another line.

[SILENCE — Describe what happens in the pause]

**GARRICK**: ...Line after meaningful pause.

### Gameplay Note

> Player explores [area] for approximately X minutes. Random encounters with [enemies]. Key items: [list]. When player reaches [trigger], next scene begins.

### Choice: [Choice Name]

The player must decide:

**[A] Choice text shown to player**
→ [What happens narratively. Which scenes change. Long-term consequence.]

**[B] Choice text shown to player**
→ [What happens narratively. Which scenes change. Long-term consequence.]

**[C] Choice text shown to player** (if available based on previous choices)
→ [Requirements to unlock this option. Narrative result.]
```

### Stage Direction Conventions

- *Italics* for all stage directions
- Describe physical actions, not emotions: "*She turns away*" not "*She feels sad*"
- Note character-specific tells from the voice guide
- Camera suggestions in brackets: *[Camera pulls back to show the full scope of the ruined city]*
- Sound cues in brackets: *[The low hum of crystals grows louder]*

### Dialogue Conventions

- **Bold character name** followed by colon, then dialogue
- No quotation marks around dialogue
- Use em-dashes for interruptions: "I was just saying—" "Nobody asked."
- Use ellipses for trailing off: "I thought maybe we could..."
- Parenthetical stage directions mid-line: "I'm fine." *She is not fine.* "Let's keep moving."
- Ash's "dialogue" is always described in narration, never in bold-name format

## Continuity Rules

### Things That MUST Be Consistent

1. **Kael uses they/them pronouns** — always. No exceptions.
2. **Nyx uses they/them pronouns** — always.
3. **Cipher uses they/them pronouns** — always.
4. **Ash uses they/them pronouns** — always.
5. **Lyra's solidity increases** as fragments are collected (translucent → semi-solid → mostly solid)
6. **Iris's prosthetic is her LEFT arm** — she's right-handed
7. **Garrick's shield has a SCRATCHED-OUT Shepherd emblem** — don't forget this detail
8. **Nyx has no mouth** — they speak directly into minds, described as hearing their voice "inside your head"
9. **The Severance happened 300 years ago** — current year is 300 PS
10. **Echo Hunters capture/dispel Echoes** — Kael is unusual for COLLECTING them
11. **Party order of recruitment**: Lyra (NPC) → Iris → Garrick → Nyx → Cipher → Sienna → Ash
12. **Three Resonance Anchors**: Kael, Cipher, and Lyra (revealed in Act II)

### Foreshadowing Threads

Plant these early, pay off later:

| Thread | Plant (Act I) | Grow (Act II) | Payoff (Act III) |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Kael's nature | No childhood memories, drawn to Echoes | Dreams of The Severance from "wrong" perspective | Revealed as Convergence fragment |
| Lyra as Anchor | She's "conveniently" near each fragment | Her fragmentation seems too deliberate | She fragmented herself on purpose |
| Vex's plan | Initiative collecting crystals aggressively | Resonance Cage pieces found in labs | Full Cage revealed |
| Null's pain | Shepherd devotion seems genuine | Null is partially crystalline (hypocrite) | She hates what she's become |
| Nyx's identity | What AM I? | Echo addiction, memory collecting | Choosing selfhood |
| Iris's brother | Mentioned in passing, "still in the military" | Dane appears as antagonist | Must choose: save Dane or mission |
| Garrick's daughter | He flinches at children, visits old shrines | Echo of Mara found | Confrontation with her Echo |

4. **Dread**: Inside The Hollows, reality breaks
5. **Betrayal/trust**: Kael's nature revealed to party
