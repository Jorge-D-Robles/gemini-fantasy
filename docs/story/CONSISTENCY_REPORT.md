## Executive Summary

Both acts are exceptionally well-written with consistent character voices, strong emotional pacing, and meticulous foreshadowing. The writing avoids nearly all banned AI-isms and maintains distinct character voices throughout. Issues found are polish-level -- no fundamental structural problems.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Act III)

### 1. Ash Anchor Discrepancy [CRITICAL]
The style guide says **three** Anchors: Kael, Cipher, Lyra. The lore doc AND script treat Ash as an Anchor too. In Ch20, Ash says "I am an Anchor." Either:
- Update the style guide to acknowledge four Anchor-capable individuals, OR
- Clarify that Ash is Resonance-sensitive but not one of the three core Anchors

**This affects Act III mechanics and all four endings.**

### 2. Prophet Null Pronoun Discrepancy [HIGH]
- Character doc: "Gender ambiguous"
- Lore doc: Uses she/her
- Script: Uses she/her via other characters

Pick one and enforce across all documents.

### 3. Story Runtime Mismatch [HIGH]
- Lore doc: ~40-hour campaign, Act I = Hours 1-15
- Style guide: 25-hour main story, Act I = Hours 1-9
- Script: Follows the style guide's 25-hour model

Update the lore doc to match.

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Dane Name Drop in Ch3
Initiative Tech says "Corporal Dane" but Iris shows no reaction. Either add a subtle reaction (prosthetic clench) or change the soldier's name.

### 5. Lyra's Timeline Inconsistency (Ch18 vs Ch19)
- Ch18: Lyra says she knew about Kael "Since Prismfall"
- Ch19: Lyra says "From the beginning"
Add a clarifying line: "I told you Prismfall. That was the confirmation. The suspicion was older."

### 6. Lyra's Ch19 Confession
The exposition block is too dense. Add 2-3 more character interruptions to break it up.

### 7. Iris Missing Ironcoast Slang
Style guide lists "crystal clear," "hollow," "echoing" as Ironcoast phrases. Iris uses none across 18 chapters. Add 2-3 instances.

### 8. Garrick's Philosophical Speeches
Ch9 and Ch10 speeches push beyond his "very short, simple, metaphorical" voice profile. Trim the lead-in sentences; let metaphors do the work.

## Low Priority Issues

9. **Ch1 Dream Sequence**: Style guide bans "dream sequences that are obviously dreams." Reframe as involuntary Echo resonance event.
10. **Lyra's surname "Reyes"**: Added in script but not in character doc. Backport to 03-characters.md.
11. **Nyx Echo-addiction seed**: Only one hint in Act I. Add 1-2 more (Nyx drawn to Story Echoes, asking to "taste" memories).
12. **Sienna reference in Act I**: No mention of Vex's sister. Add one oblique reference in Ch10.
13. **Prophet Null Void hint**: No early Shepherd weapon reference before Ch10. Add one in Ch7 (Commander Sera: "the final silence").
14. **Severance death toll**: 800 million used in script but not documented in lore doc.
15. **Kael's found-age**: Ch1 says "seven? eight?" but Ch10 Vex says "approximately six." Make discrepancy explicit.
16. **Ch18 header "The Weight She Carried"**: Close to banned pattern. Rename.
17. **Nyx analytical line in Ch15**: Three-part philosophical attribution too structured. Make messier.
18. **Gearhaven population (50,000)**: Verify against world-building doc.
19. **Ash Walker slang**: Add "little star" to regional slang guide.

## Character Voice Scores

| Character | Act I | Act II | Overall |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| Kael | 9/10 | 9/10 | Excellent. Trails off, questions, deflects with humor. |
| Iris | 9/10 | 9/10 | Clipped, military, prosthetic clenching as tell. Needs slang. |
| Garrick | 8/10 | 10/10 | Improved across acts. Stew as character device is brilliant. |
| Nyx | 10/10 | 9/10 | Standout voice. One line in Ch15 too analytical. |
| Lyra | 7/10 | 8/10 | Tends toward exposition. Needs more interruptions and surprises. |
| Cipher | — | 9/10 | Fast, paranoid, vulnerable. Tech metaphors consistent. |
| Sienna | — | 9/10 | Self-corrections masterful. Academic-to-human arc well-tracked. |
| Ash | — | 10/10 | Never speaks. Emotional projections perfectly executed. |

## Foreshadowing Health

| Thread | Planted | Growing | Paid Off | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| Kael as Anchor/Convergence | Act I Ch1 | Escalating | Ch18 | Complete |
| Lyra's truth | Act I Ch2 | Progressive | Ch19 | Complete |
| Lyra as third Anchor | Act I (subtle) | Ch12-17 | Ch19 | Complete |
| Vex's Cage | Act I Ch3 | Ch11-20 | Ch20 (operational) | Ready for Act III |
| Null's Void | Act I Ch10 | Ch15, Ch20 | Ch20 (armed) | Needs 1 more beat |
| Iris vs Dane | Act I Ch3 | Ch11-20 | Ch20 (deployment cmd) | Ready for Act III |
| Garrick's daughter | Act I Ch4 | Ch13-17 | Ongoing | Personal quest ready |
| Nyx Echo addiction | Act I Ch6 | Ch11-17 | Ongoing | Needs more seeding |
| Four endings | N/A | Ch15-20 | N/A | All on table |
| "Almost something beautiful" | Ch9 | Ch10 | Recurring refrain | Strong |

## Strengths (What's Working)

1. **Specificity of detail** -- "Two Kids Arguing About a Frog" as Echo label, "World's Okayest Physicist" mug
2. **Character differentiation in group scenes** -- each reacts differently to same stimulus
3. **Earned emotional escalation** -- breathing chapters (4, 6, 16) between gut punches
4. **Vex as rational villain** -- tea, polite conversation, "development costs"
5. **Nyx as comic relief that earns depth** -- butterfly/bread sequence → existential tenderness
6. **Ash's nonverbal communication** -- emotional projections + drawings, never dialogue
7. **The Hollows sequence** -- Memory/Emotion/Identity layers, party split, earned revelation
8. **Garrick's stew as throughline** -- normalcy and care across escalating crisis
9. **Sienna's self-corrections** -- "sub-- the *people*" as character development device
10. **The Convergence's "Please"** -- devastating because earned across 3 chapters

## Recommendations for Act III Writer

1. **Resolve the Ash Anchor question FIRST** -- this affects the Nexus mechanics and all endings
2. **Maintain the stew throughline** -- Garrick cooking should appear at least once in Act III
3. **Pay off Nyx's Echo addiction** -- this thread needs resolution
4. **Iris vs Dane confrontation** must feel earned -- she's been building to this for 20 chapters
5. **Garrick vs Prophet Null** needs the personal dimension (both betrayed by faith)
6. **Lyra's full solidification** at the Nexus should be visually striking
7. **The four endings must feel like genuine choices**, not good/bad/neutral
8. **"We were almost something beautiful"** should recur and resolve in the Harmony ending
9. **Keep the 70/30 plot/character ratio** -- don't sacrifice character moments for climax pacing
10. **Ash's agency** -- they chose to walk. Don't revert to "protected child" in the finale.
