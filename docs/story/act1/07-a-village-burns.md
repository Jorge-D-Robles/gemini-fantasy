# Chapter 7: A Village Burns

**Location**: Roothollow, Verdant Tangle
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Estimated Playtime**: 50-65 minutes
**Emotional Arc**: Peace -> alarm -> desperation -> rage -> grief

The party returns to Roothollow to resupply before the journey south. What they find is smoke. The Shepherds of Silence have come for the village -- not for Lyra, not for the party, but as part of a wider purge of Resonance-dependent settlements. Roothollow's crystal lanterns, its Echo-powered water pumps, the gentle Resonance that keeps the ancient trees healthy -- all of it makes the village a target. Kael's home is burning, and for the first time, the story's stakes aren't abstract. The chapter forces every character to act under pressure, and the consequences -- who lives, what's saved, what's lost -- depend on the player's choices.

## Scene 1: Coming Home

**Location**: Northern approach to Roothollow
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Late afternoon, sky oddly colored
**Gameplay Context**: Transition into crisis
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 minutes

### Setting

The forest path to Roothollow. The party has been traveling south, then doubled back for supplies. They're close to home -- Kael knows every tree, every root. But something is wrong. The birds are silent. The crystal growths along the path are dark -- not dimmed, but *off*, like someone killed them.

And the sky to the north has an orange tinge that doesn't belong to sunset.

### Realization

**KAEL**: *(Stopping mid-stride.)* That's not the sun.

**GARRICK**: *(Already moving.)* Fire. Large. Northeast.

**IRIS**: That's the direction of--

**KAEL**: *(Running.)* Roothollow.

*They run. The orange glow brightens. Through the trees, the sound of shouting. Breaking wood. Crystal shattering.*

*The last tree line clears, and they see it.*

*Roothollow is on fire. Not all of it -- the massive trees are too wet to burn quickly -- but the platforms, the bridges, the market stalls. Flames climb the lower levels, fed by dry goods and the deliberate application of something accelerant. Crystal lanterns along the bridges have been smashed, their fragments ground into the wood.*

*On the main platform, figures in white and gray robes, hoods up, move with purpose. They carry staffs tipped with glowing blue crystal -- Purification Staves, designed to shatter Resonance formations. The Shepherds of Silence.*

*Villagers run, scream, carry children. The rope bridges sway dangerously under panicked weight. Some have collapsed -- people cling to ropes over drops.*

**KAEL**: *(Voice breaking.)* No. No, no, no--

**GARRICK**: *(Grabbing Kael's shoulder, firm.)* Focus. How many Shepherds?

*Kael stares. Forces themselves to count.*

**KAEL**: Eight-- ten. Maybe twelve. They're spread across the mid-level. The canopy level isn't burning yet.

**IRIS**: *(Combat mode, scanning.)* Their formation is standard Shepherd purge pattern. Sweep from ground up. Destroy crystal infrastructure first, then move to residences. They're not trying to kill people -- they're destroying the village's ability to function.

**GARRICK**: That's how it starts. "We're only destroying the crystals." Then someone resists, and it becomes something worse.

*Garrick unhooks his shield. His face has gone still -- the absolute stillness Kael saw at the shrine. But his eyes are different. They're burning.*

**GARRICK**: I know this. I've done this. From the other side.

*He steps forward.*

**GARRICK**: Not again.

## Scene 2: The Battle of Roothollow

**Location**: Roothollow, Mid-Level
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Late afternoon, firelight
**Gameplay Context**: Multi-stage battle encounter, tactical choices
**Estimated Duration**: 15-20 minutes

### Setting

The mid-level market platform, burning. Shepherd operatives move through the smoke. Villagers are trapped on platforms with collapsed bridge access. Elder Morin's study is directly below, in the root level.

### The Fight

*The party splits onto the platform. Garrick charges the nearest Shepherd -- a young man, barely twenty, who flinches at the sight of an ex-Shield-Bearer bearing down with a shield the size of a table.*

*Combat begins.*

### Choice: Tactical Priority

The player must choose their approach. This affects the battle and the aftermath.

**[A] Save the villagers first -- protect the bridges**
-> The party focuses on rescuing trapped villagers. They fight defensively, prioritizing crowd control and protecting civilians. Result: More villagers saved, but more of the village burns. Kael's home in the canopy level is destroyed. The market is gutted.

**[B] Attack the Shepherds directly -- stop the destruction**
-> The party goes on the offensive. They push the Shepherds back before more damage is done. Result: Village structure is better preserved, but some villagers are injured in the crossfire. One NPC (determined by earlier interactions) is hurt.

**[C] Split the party -- Garrick and Iris fight, Kael and Nyx evacuate**
-> Tactical split. Garrick and Iris handle combat (player controls them). Kael and Nyx guide villagers to safety (automated, with check-in cutscenes). Result: Balanced outcome -- moderate damage, moderate casualties. Best for Kael's character arc -- they're forced to choose between fighting and protecting.

### Boss: Shepherd Purification Squad

> Multi-wave encounter. 3 waves of Shepherd combatants.

> **Wave 1**: Shepherd Acolytes (3) -- basic melee, low HP. They're young, inexperienced, scared.
> **Wave 2**: Shepherd Purifiers (2) -- Purification Staves deal magic damage and can shatter party crystal equipment temporarily. Medium difficulty.
> **Wave 3**: Shepherd Commander -- experienced, heavy armor, uses "Silence" ability (disables Resonance abilities for 2 turns). The Commander recognizes Garrick.

### The Commander

*After wave 2, the Shepherd Commander steps forward. Female, middle-aged, scarred, calm. She sees Garrick and stops.*

**SHEPHERD COMMANDER (SERA)**: ...Garrick Thorne.

*Garrick doesn't lower his shield.*

**GARRICK**: Sera.

**SERA**: Shield-Bearer. Twelve years gone. We searched for you.

**GARRICK**: I wasn't hiding.

**SERA**: No. You were wandering. Like a man without purpose. *(She looks at the party.)* And now you fight for crystal-addled villagers alongside an Initiative deserter and a... *(She stares at Nyx.)* ...what *is* that?

**NYX** *(in everyone's heads)*: I'm Nyx. Is that your purpose? Burning people's homes?

*Sera flinches at the mental voice.*

**SERA**: Abomination. *(To Garrick.)* You've fallen further than I thought, old friend.

**GARRICK**: You've risen higher. Commander now. *(Beat.)* How many villages, Sera?

**SERA**: Enough to save the souls inside them.

**GARRICK**: Did you save Willowmere?

*Sera goes still.*

**GARRICK**: That's what I thought.

*Boss fight: Shepherd Commander Sera. She's tough -- uses Silence frequently, has a counter-attack that triggers when hit by Resonance abilities, and can buff remaining Shepherds. Garrick gets a damage bonus against her (personal stake). Key mechanic: Sera can be talked down mid-fight.*

### Mid-Battle Choice (During Sera's fight)

At half HP, Sera falters. The player gets a dialogue option:

**[A] Keep fighting -- she made her choice.**
-> Battle continues. Sera is defeated. She's left unconscious but alive. Hard-line response.

**[B] Garrick: "Sera. It's over. Walk away."**
-> Garrick speaks. Sera hesitates. "You were the best of us, Garrick. How do you stand with them?" Garrick: "Because I finally opened my eyes. You could too." Sera retreats with her remaining forces. Some Shepherds scatter into the forest. Less damage overall -- the attack ends sooner.

## Scene 3: Aftermath

**Location**: Roothollow, various levels
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Evening, smoke and firelight
**Gameplay Context**: Emotional aftermath, consequences of choices
**Estimated Duration**: 10-12 minutes

### Setting

The fires are mostly out. Villagers carry water buckets, tend the wounded, salvage what they can. The mid-level market is badly damaged. Several bridges are down. Crystal lanterns are shattered. The gentle hum of Resonance that used to pervade the village is gone -- replaced by the crackle of cooling wood and the sound of people crying.

### The Cost

*Kael walks through the damage. Their face is blank -- not calm, but overloaded. Too much to process.*

*The specific consequences depend on the player's choice in Scene 2:*

**If Choice A (Save villagers)**:
*The market is gutted. Maeve's shop is a shell. Petra's food stall is gone. The canopy level is damaged -- Kael's room is open to the sky, their Echo collection jars shattered on the ground below. Hundreds of Echoes, carefully collected over seven years, dissipating into the air like smoke.*

*Kael kneels in the debris of their collection. Glass shards. Fading light. The memories inside evaporating.*

**KAEL**: *(Picking up a shard that still glows faintly.)* Mrs. Calloway. The knitter.

*The glow fades. Gone.*

**KAEL**: Seven years. All of them. Gone.

**If Choice B (Attack Shepherds)**:
*The market is partially standing. Some structures saved. But Tomas, the neighbor, was caught in a crystal detonation. He's alive but badly injured -- crystal shrapnel in his shoulder, Resonance burns. Petra tends to him.*

**PETRA**: He was trying to save the water pump crystal. Stupid, brave man.

**TOMAS**: *(Through pain.)* The pump serves the whole canopy level. Without it--

**PETRA**: Without it, we carry water. With you dead, I lose my best customer.

**If Choice C (Split party)**:
*Moderate damage across the board. The market is functional but scarred. Kael's room is intact but many shelves have fallen -- some Echoes saved, others lost. No major NPC injuries, but the village feels diminished.*

### All Paths Converge

*Regardless of choice, Elder Morin is standing in his study -- intact, the root level being underground and largely untouched. But he looks older. The books on his shelves have crystal dust on them from shattered formations above.*

**MORIN**: Sixteen villages in the Verdant Tangle in the last three months. Roothollow is the seventeenth. The Shepherds are escalating.

**KAEL**: This wasn't about us? About Lyra?

**MORIN**: No. This is a regional purge. The Shepherds have decided the Verdant Tangle is too crystal-dependent. They're destroying Resonance infrastructure village by village.

**GARRICK**: Standard doctrine. Purge the region, force the population to abandon crystal technology, then move on.

**MORIN**: The question is why now. The Shepherds have been restrained for years. Something has changed their calculus.

**IRIS**: *(Holding up the data chip from her belt.)* I might know what. The Initiative's accelerated operations in the Tangle. The survey teams, the push for crystal deposits. The Shepherds would see that as a provocation. "The Initiative is expanding Resonance technology, so we need to destroy it faster."

**MORIN**: Two factions. Both escalating. And the people in between get burned.

*Kael stands at the entrance to Morin's study. Behind them, the village is scarred and smoking. Ahead, the map on Morin's desk shows the southern route to the Crystalline Steppes.*

**KAEL**: We can't stay here. The Initiative is coming from the east and the Shepherds are burning from the north. If we stay, we bring both of them down on whatever's left of Roothollow.

**MORIN**: You're not responsible for this, Kael.

**KAEL**: Maybe not. But Lyra's next fragment is south. The tracker points to the Crystalline Steppes. If we move, we draw attention away from here. If we stay...

**MORIN**: *(Quietly.)* You're growing up, Kael. I don't entirely like it.

**KAEL**: Yeah. Me neither.

## Scene 4: Leaving Home

**Location**: Roothollow, northern exit
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Night
**Gameplay Context**: Departure scene, emotional weight, transition
**Estimated Duration**: 5-7 minutes

### Setting

Roothollow at night, lit by improvised torches instead of crystal lanterns. The party stands at the exit bridge, packs loaded. Villagers are working by firelight -- rebuilding, patching, surviving.

### Goodbyes

*The party is ready to leave. Several NPCs approach.*

**MAEVE**: *(Handing Kael a pack.)* Supplies. What I could save from the shop. Don't argue.

**KAEL**: Maeve, you need these--

**MAEVE**: I need you to come back alive more than I need a sack of healing crystals. Take them.

**OLD WICK**: *(To Garrick.)* I saw you fight. Shield wall against the purifier staff. Textbook. *(Grudging respect.)* You're not bad for a Shepherd.

**GARRICK**: Former Shepherd.

**WICK**: I know what I said.

**YARA**: *(Running up, grabbing Kael's hand.)* You're leaving.

**KAEL**: For a while. I have to go find something important.

**YARA**: More memories?

**KAEL**: *(Kneeling.)* Kind of. A person made of memories. She needs help.

**YARA**: Like the butterflies?

**KAEL**: *(Throat tight.)* Yeah, Yara. Like the butterflies.

*Yara looks at Nyx. Nyx looks at Yara. Two children studying each other -- one made of flesh and curiosity, one made of shadow and starlight.*

**YARA**: You're pretty.

**NYX**: *(Starfield eyes brightening.)* Thank you. You smell like honey.

**YARA**: That's the cakes. *(To Kael.)* I like your new friend.

*Kael stands. Looks at Roothollow one last time. The damaged bridges, the dark lanterns, the smoke stains on the ancient bark.*

**KAEL**: *(To the village, not to anyone specific.)* I'll fix this. Somehow. I'll fix all of it.

*They turn and walk across the bridge. Iris, Garrick, and Nyx follow.*

*The bridge sways. The village falls behind. The southern road opens up: dark forest, starlight, the first cold breath of approaching winter.*

## Camp Scene: Night After Roothollow

**Location**: Forest camp, south of Roothollow
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Late night
**Estimated Duration**: 5-6 minutes

### The Weight

*Camp. No cooking tonight. Nobody's hungry. The fire is small. Kael sits apart from the others, knees drawn up, staring at nothing.*

*Iris approaches. Sits down next to them. Not close enough to touch. Close enough to be there.*

**IRIS**: It's not your fault.

**KAEL**: I know.

**IRIS**: Do you?

*Long silence.*

**KAEL**: When I was a kid -- after Morin found me, when I was learning to be a person instead of whatever I was before -- I used to have nightmares about the village being gone. I'd wake up and run to the window and look out, and the trees would be there, and the lights would be on, and I'd think: "It's still here. I'm still here."

*Their voice is flat. Controlled.*

**KAEL**: Tonight I looked out and the lights were off.

**IRIS**: The lights will come back on. Maeve is already organizing repairs. Tomas is--

**KAEL**: I know. I know they'll rebuild. They're stubborn. Root deep, every one of them.

*Beat.*

**KAEL**: But the Echoes, Iris. My collection. Seven years. Hundreds of lives I was keeping safe. And now they're just... gone. Scattered. Mrs. Calloway and the Merchant and the Two Kids Arguing About a Frog and all of them, just... smoke.

*Iris's prosthetic hand moves -- she almost reaches for Kael's shoulder, then stops. Then does it. Metal fingers resting on fabric, gentle despite the mechanism.*

**IRIS**: You'll find more.

**KAEL**: It's not about finding more. It's about-- they trusted me. Those memories. I told them I'd keep them safe, and I didn't.

**IRIS**: Kael. They're Echoes. They don't--

*She stops herself. Looks at Kael's face. Changes what she was going to say.*

**IRIS**: ...They were important. And losing them hurts. And that's real.

*Kael leans slightly into the hand on their shoulder. Just slightly.*

**KAEL**: Lyra's out there in pieces. Nyx is brand new. The Shepherds are burning everything. The Initiative is hunting everything. And I'm sitting here mourning a jar labeled "Two Kids Arguing About a Frog."

**IRIS**: You're allowed to mourn small things and fight big ones at the same time. That's not weakness. That's being a person.

[SILENCE -- The fire crackles. Somewhere in the dark, Garrick is singing -- low, almost inaudible, a Cindral Wastes lullaby. Near him, Nyx sits with starfield eyes dimmed to their softest glow, listening.]

## End of Chapter 7

**Chapter Hook**: Roothollow is scarred. The party heads south toward Prismfall and the Crystalline Steppes, where Lyra's next fragment waits. Both factions are escalating -- the Shepherds burning, the Initiative surveying. The party is no longer exploring a mystery; they're running from converging threats while racing to solve one. And Kael's world has gotten smaller and more urgent: this isn't about curiosity anymore. It's personal.

**Emotional Summary**: The chapter is the game's first gut punch. Roothollow isn't a random village -- the player has walked its bridges, talked to its people, eaten Petra's honey cakes. The attack makes good on the earlier warnings about faction escalation and transforms abstract political tensions into visceral, personal loss. The tactical choice during the battle gives the player real agency (and real consequences), and the aftermath scenes earn their grief through specificity -- it's not "the village burned," it's "Mrs. Calloway's jar is gone."

**Trope Subversion**: The "hometown burns" scene is a JRPG staple, but this version has no single villain to blame. The Shepherds aren't cackling -- they're executing doctrine they genuinely believe will save souls. Sera knows Garrick. She's not a monster; she's a colleague from a different path. And the attack isn't about the party at all -- it's a regional campaign that would have happened with or without Kael. The world moves without waiting for the protagonist.

**Foreshadowing Planted**:
- Sera and Garrick's history (Shepherds will be complex antagonists, not one-dimensional)
- The regional purge pattern (Act II's larger conflict)
- "Something has changed the Shepherds' calculus" (Prophet Null's escalation, responding to Initiative)
- Kael's childhood nightmares about the village disappearing (Convergence memory bleed)
- Iris touching Kael's shoulder (relationship building, optional romance thread)
