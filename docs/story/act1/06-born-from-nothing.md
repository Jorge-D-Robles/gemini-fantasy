# Chapter 6: Born from Nothing

**Location**: The Hollows outskirts, eastern Verdant Tangle border
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick -> Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Estimated Playtime**: 45-55 minutes
**Emotional Arc**: Unease -> shock -> confusion -> tenderness -> laughter

On the road south from Roothollow, the party passes near the Hollows border -- the zone where reality starts to fray. Something follows them. Something small, dark, curious, and entirely impossible. Nyx doesn't arrive like a party member. They arrive like a question nobody asked, and the chapter is the party's fumbling attempt to answer it. Nyx is innocent and powerful and terrifying and funny, and the debate over what they *are* -- Echo? Convergence fragment? New consciousness? Something else? -- becomes the game's first real philosophical argument between characters.

## Scene 1: The Border

**Location**: Eastern Verdant Tangle, near Hollows outskirts
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick
**Time**: Late morning, air feels strange -- charged, tingling
**Gameplay Context**: Travel scene, atmosphere building
**Estimated Duration**: 5-7 minutes

### Setting

The forest changes. Subtly at first: the trees lean at wrong angles, the shadows fall in directions that don't match the sun, and a low hum vibrates through the ground -- not unpleasant, but persistent. The crystal growths here are stranger -- they pulse in patterns that look almost deliberate, like a heartbeat or a signal. The party is passing through the border zone between the Verdant Tangle and the Hollows outskirts, following the southern road toward the Crystalline Steppes.

### Walking the Edge

**IRIS**: *(Checking instruments.)* Resonance levels are spiking. We're near the Hollows border.

**GARRICK**: I can feel it. The crystals in my arms are... responding.

*He holds up a forearm. The crystal veins beneath his skin are glowing brighter than usual, pulsing in rhythm with the ambient hum.*

**KAEL**: Same. My scars are tingling.

*Kael pulls off a glove. The crystalline scarring on their palm is luminous, thin lines of light tracing patterns on their skin.*

**IRIS**: We should move through quickly. Prolonged exposure to Hollows-border Resonance can cause disorientation, temporal perception shifts, and in extreme cases--

**GARRICK**: *(Suddenly alert.)* Something's watching us.

*Everyone stops. Garrick has his shield up, eyes scanning the tree line.*

**IRIS**: Where?

**GARRICK**: Everywhere. And nowhere. I can't pin it down. But something is there.

*The forest is silent. Even the birds have stopped.*

*Then: a giggle. Not from a direction. From inside their heads.*

*All three of them flinch.*

**KAEL**: Did you--

**IRIS**: Inside my skull. Yes.

**GARRICK**: ...Yes.

*The giggle again. High, bright, genuinely delighted. Like a child seeing something wonderful for the first time.*

*And then, stepping out from behind a tree that shouldn't have been able to hide anything:*

*A child. Small. Androgynous. Skin that shifts between solid and shadow, like looking at a person through rippling water. Eyes that are not eyes -- they're windows into a field of tiny stars, actual pinpoints of light in darkness. Hair that isn't hair -- wisps of crystalline darkness that float independently, drifting like seaweed in an invisible current.*

*No mouth. The lower face is smooth, featureless below the nose.*

*They're wearing simple, timeless clothing that looks woven from the substance of night itself. Barefoot. Their feet are clean despite the forest floor.*

*They look at Kael. The starfield eyes brighten.*

**NYX** *(inside their heads, like hearing a thought that isn't yours)*: Oh! You're loud. All three of you. So much noise inside.

## Scene 2: First Contact

**Location**: Forest clearing, Hollows border
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick
**Time**: Late morning
**Gameplay Context**: Major character introduction, dialogue-heavy
**Estimated Duration**: 10-12 minutes

### Setting

The clearing where Nyx appeared. The ambient Resonance is higher here -- crystal growths pulse in time with Nyx's movements, as if the environment responds to them. The party stands in a loose semicircle, weapons not drawn but hands ready.

### The Conversation

*Garrick has placed himself between Nyx and the rest of the party, shield raised. Nyx peers around the shield's edge with bottomless curiosity.*

**NYX** *(in their heads)*: Your metal is very old. It remembers things. *(They reach toward the shield.)* Can I touch it?

**GARRICK**: ...What are you?

**NYX**: *(Head tilting, starfield eyes dimming slightly with confusion.)* I don't know. Is that an important question? You all seem to know what you are. Is it something everyone knows?

**IRIS**: *(To Kael, low.)* It's speaking inside our heads. No vocalizations. Direct Resonance projection into the auditory cortex. That's-- I've never seen anything do that.

**KAEL**: Lyra doesn't do that. She speaks with an echo effect, but it's audible sound.

**IRIS**: This is different. This is direct consciousness-to-consciousness communication. The Initiative theorized it was possible but never achieved it.

**NYX**: *(Having apparently heard all of this despite it being a whisper.)* You're talking about me like I'm not here. I don't like that. I can hear you even when you're quiet. The quiet talking is louder, actually. It has more color.

*They walk toward Kael. Each step is silent -- their feet don't disturb the ground cover.*

**NYX**: You're the loudest. *(They look at Kael with unnerving directness.)* Inside you there's a sound like... all the sounds. Every sound that ever was, but very far away. Like listening to a city from underwater.

*Kael's breath catches.*

**KAEL**: What do you mean?

**NYX**: I don't know how to explain it better. You're shaped like the other two, but inside you're shaped like *that*. *(They point toward the Hollows.)* Like where I'm from.

*Everyone goes very still.*

**GARRICK**: Where you're from.

**NYX**: The place that doesn't have edges. Where everything is all the other things at the same time. I was there, and then I wasn't. I walked out and the trees were here and the sky was above instead of below and I thought: this is new. I want to see more.

*They spin around slowly, looking at everything -- the trees, the crystals, the sky, the party members -- with equal fascination.*

**NYX**: Everything here has a name! The trees are "trees" and the dirt is "dirt" and the sky is "sky." In the other place, nothing has a name. Everything just is.

**IRIS**: *(To Kael.)* It walked out of the Hollows. A self-aware entity that emerged from the reality-break zone. Kael, this is a Conscious Echo, but not like Lyra. Lyra is a pre-Severance consciousness that survived. This is--

**NYX**: *(Turning to Iris.)* I'm not an Echo. I know what Echoes are. They're the left-behind pieces. Recordings that loop. I'm not a loop. I'm new. *(Beat.)* At least, I think I'm new. How do you tell?

**KAEL**: *(Kneeling to Nyx's height.)* You tell by whether you're surprised by things. Echoes loop the same moments over and over. They can't be surprised.

**NYX**: Oh! Then I'm definitely new. Everything surprises me. *(They look at Garrick.)* Your sadness surprises me. It's so big. Why do you carry it all at once instead of putting some down?

*Garrick goes absolutely still. The stillness of a man who's been seen through.*

**GARRICK**: ...Some things you can't put down.

**NYX**: Why not? *(Genuinely confused.)* In the other place, nothing weighs anything. You can let go of anything. You just... open your hands.

*They demonstrate. Tiny hands opening, fingers splaying, like releasing a bird.*

**GARRICK**: *(Very quietly.)* It's different here.

**NYX**: *(Dimming slightly.)* Oh. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

**GARRICK**: No. No, you didn't hurt me.

*He lowers the shield. Kneels, slowly, putting himself at Nyx's eye level. His expression has shifted from wariness to something raw -- a man who once had a child looking at a being that has a child's shape.*

**GARRICK**: You didn't hurt me. You just saw something I try to keep hidden. That's... different from hurting.

**NYX**: *(Brightening.)* Oh! Like your shield symbol. You hide it but it's still there underneath.

*Garrick closes his eyes for a moment.*

**GARRICK**: Yeah. Like that.

## Scene 3: The Debate

**Location**: Forest clearing
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick
**Time**: Midday
**Gameplay Context**: Character interaction, philosophical conflict
**Estimated Duration**: 8-10 minutes

### Setting

The clearing. Nyx has wandered to the edge to examine a crystal growth, leaving the party to talk. They can see Nyx poking the crystal with one finger; the crystal responds by pulsing in rhythm with the poke.

### What Is Nyx?

*The three huddle.*

**IRIS**: We need to talk about this. That thing--

**KAEL**: They.

**IRIS**: *They* walked out of the Hollows. The Hollows, Kael. The reality-break zone. The place where time and space don't work right. Whatever they are, they're connected to the most dangerous anomaly on the planet.

**KAEL**: They're also a child. Or shaped like one. And they're scared and curious and they don't know what they are.

**IRIS**: That's exactly what makes them dangerous. A powerful, naive entity with no understanding of consequences? That's a disaster waiting to happen.

**GARRICK**: Or a miracle. Depends on what we do next.

**IRIS**: A miracle? Garrick, the Shepherds would call this an abomination.

**GARRICK**: The Shepherds would be wrong. *(Firm.)* They're wrong about a lot of things. I spent forty years learning that.

**IRIS**: I'm not saying we should destroy them! I'm saying we need to understand what they are before we decide anything.

**KAEL**: Then let's ask them.

*Kael walks over to where Nyx is still poking the crystal. The crystal has started growing toward Nyx's finger, like a plant toward sunlight.*

**KAEL**: Nyx. Can I ask you some questions?

**NYX**: Yes! I like questions. They're like shapes that need filling in.

**KAEL**: How long have you been... here? Outside the Hollows?

**NYX**: *(Thinking, starfield eyes swirling.)* I don't understand "how long." In the other place, everything happens at the same time. Here, things happen in a line. One after another. It's very strange. I've been watching you since... *(they gesture vaguely)* ...several "things happening in a line" ago.

**IRIS**: They've been following us. For how long?

**NYX**: Since the city. The overgrown one. You went inside and I watched. I wanted to go in but the crystals there are sad and loud and I didn't want to be that close to so many endings.

**KAEL**: You followed us through the Overgrown Capital?

**NYX**: From outside. Through the trees. I was invisible. I can be invisible when I want. But you-- *(pointing at Kael)* --you almost saw me twice. Because of the loud thing inside you.

**KAEL**: You keep saying I'm "loud." What does that mean?

**NYX**: *(Frustrated, searching for words.)* You're... you're like a crystal that's tuned to the same frequency as the other place. Where I'm from. You feel like home. But you're in a person shape. That's confusing.

*Kael and Iris exchange a look.*

**IRIS**: *(Mouthing.)* Anchor?

*Kael shakes their head minutely. Not now.*

**KAEL**: Nyx. Do you want to come with us?

*Iris inhales sharply. Garrick doesn't react.*

**NYX**: *(Starfield eyes blazing bright.)* Yes! You're going places and seeing things and I want to see things. In the other place, everything is already seen. Here, there are new things. I want new things.

*They pause.*

**NYX**: But... is that okay? To want things? In the other place, wanting didn't happen. Everything just was. Here, I want things, and it feels strange. Like a new organ.

**KAEL**: Wanting things is... human.

**NYX**: But I'm not human.

**KAEL**: *(After a beat.)* Neither am I. Not entirely. And wanting things is still okay.

## Scene 4: Nyx Meets the World

**Location**: Road south, toward Crystalline Steppes
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Afternoon
**Gameplay Context**: Travel with new party member, comedic moments, bonding
**Estimated Duration**: 10-12 minutes

### Setting

The road south from the Hollows border. The landscape gradually opens -- trees thinning, grassland appearing, the first hints of the Crystalline Steppes visible as a shimmer on the horizon. Nyx walks with the party, examining everything with manic curiosity.

### Nyx Discovers Things

*A montage of Nyx encountering the mundane world:*

**Nyx and a Butterfly:**
*A butterfly lands on Nyx's extended hand. Nyx freezes. The starfield eyes go enormous.*

**NYX**: It has colors that aren't inside. The colors are on its outside. How does it carry them?

**KAEL**: It's born with them. The patterns are in its... structure. Like crystal formations, but biological.

**NYX**: Is it thinking?

**KAEL**: Not like you or me. It's more like... instinct. Automatic.

**NYX**: *(Whispering, inside heads.)* It's beautiful. Is everything like this? Made of colors and instinct and not thinking?

**KAEL**: A lot of things are, yeah.

*The butterfly flies away. Nyx watches it go with an expression of total loss.*

**NYX**: I want it to come back.

**GARRICK**: It will. There are always more butterflies.

**NYX**: *(Awed.)* Always more?

**Nyx and Eating:**
*The party stops for lunch. Garrick offers Nyx a piece of bread. Nyx holds it, examines it from every angle, sniffs it.*

**NYX**: What do I do with it?

**IRIS**: You eat it.

**NYX**: How?

*Everyone pauses. They look at Nyx's face. Smooth below the nose. No mouth.*

**KAEL**: *(Carefully.)* You, uh...

**NYX**: Oh! I see. You put things inside through the opening. *(They look at the others eating.)* I don't have one of those.

**GARRICK**: ...No. You don't.

**NYX**: Is that bad?

**GARRICK**: *(Gently.)* No. You're just built different.

**NYX**: *(Turning the bread over.)* Can I hold it anyway? It smells nice.

**GARRICK**: You can hold it as long as you like.

*Nyx holds the bread for the rest of the meal. Occasionally sniffs it. Seems content.*

**Nyx and Shadows:**
*The sun shifts. Nyx sees their own shadow for the first time.*

**NYX**: *(Jumping backward.)* There's a dark me on the ground!

**IRIS**: *(Startled.)* That's your shadow. Everything that blocks light casts a--

**NYX**: It moves when I move!

*Nyx experiments: stepping, jumping, waving arms. The shadow mimics each motion.*

**NYX**: It's copying me. *(Suspicious.)* Is it a different me?

**KAEL**: No, it's just an absence of light. Where your body blocks the sun--

**NYX**: *(Not listening, crouching to examine the shadow up close.)* Hello. Are you me?

*The shadow does not respond. Nyx seems slightly disappointed.*

**NYX**: It's not very talkative.

**IRIS**: *(To Kael, aside.)* This is what our infiltration-of-an-Initiative-facility team looks like. A kid who just discovered shadows.

**KAEL**: *(Grinning despite themselves.)* Could be worse.

**IRIS**: How?

**KAEL**: Could be two kids.

### Gameplay Note

> Nyx joins the party as a full party member. Abilities: STARFIRE (powerful magic damage -- but has a random chance to target wrong enemy), VOID TOUCH (drains enemy EE), and CURIOSITY (randomly discovers a hidden item or weakness at the start of battle). Nyx is a wild card: highest Magic stat in the party, very low Defense, abilities are powerful but occasionally unpredictable. Thematically, they represent the risk and reward of engaging with consciousness directly.

## Scene 5: What Nyx Knows

**Location**: Campsite, forest edge near Steppes border
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Evening
**Gameplay Context**: Lore revelation, party dynamics
**Estimated Duration**: 6-8 minutes

### Setting

Camp at the edge of the forest, where the trees give way to grassland. The Crystalline Steppes stretch to the south -- a vast plain dotted with crystal formations that catch the last light of day. The sky is enormous. Nyx sits at the fire's edge, doing something that might be staring and might be processing. Their starfield eyes reflect the flames.

### Evening Conversation

**KAEL**: Nyx. Can I ask you about the Hollows?

**NYX**: *(Perking up.)* Yes!

**KAEL**: You said everything there happens at the same time. What does that mean?

**NYX**: *(Concentrating, visibly searching for words that fit.)* Here, things go: before, now, after. In a line. In the other place, before and now and after are all the same thing. Everything that happened is still happening. Everything that will happen is already happening.

**IRIS**: Temporal overlap. The Hollows have been documented as having non-linear time flow, but this is...

**NYX**: Inside the other place, there are so many voices. Old ones. Millions and millions. They talk and talk and talk, all at once, and none of them are listening to each other anymore. They're just... echoing. Repeating.

**KAEL**: The Echoes. The memory fragments. You can hear them from inside the Hollows?

**NYX**: I can hear everything from inside the Hollows. That's why I left. It was too loud and too still at the same time. None of the voices were new. None of them were saying anything that hadn't been said before. And then I heard you.

*They look at Kael.*

**NYX**: You were the first new thing. A voice that wasn't repeating. A sound that was going somewhere instead of in circles. So I followed it out.

*The implications settle over the camp like snow.*

**GARRICK**: You came into existence because of Kael.

**NYX**: I came into existence because I wanted to. Kael was the reason I wanted to.

**IRIS**: *(Quietly, to herself.)* A consciousness born from the desire to experience something new. That's... the opposite of an Echo. Echoes are past. Nyx is entirely present tense.

**NYX**: *(Having heard.)* Is that... okay? Being present tense?

**KAEL**: It's the best tense there is.

*Nyx's starfield eyes brighten to their fullest. The night sky above seems to brighten slightly in response, as if sympathetic.*

---

## Camp Scene: Garrick and Nyx

**Location**: Campsite, late night
**Party**: Garrick, Nyx (Kael and Iris sleeping)
**Time**: Late night
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 minutes

### Watch Duty

*Garrick sits watch. Nyx doesn't seem to sleep -- they sit nearby, legs folded under them, starfield eyes gazing at the sky. The real stars above match the stars in their eyes.*

**NYX**: Garrick.

**GARRICK**: Hmm.

**NYX**: Do you sleep?

**GARRICK**: Sometimes. Not well.

**NYX**: What happens when you sleep badly?

**GARRICK**: ...Dreams. Old ones.

**NYX**: Are dreams Echoes? They sound like Echoes. Memories that replay.

**GARRICK**: *(Considering.)* That's... not a bad way to think about it.

**NYX**: If I could eat your bad dreams, would that help?

*Garrick looks at Nyx. Their expression is earnest. The offer is genuine.*

**GARRICK**: I don't think that's how it works, little one.

**NYX**: But what if it was?

*Long silence. The fire crackles.*

**GARRICK**: Then I'd let you. But I'd worry about what they'd do to you.

**NYX**: Things can hurt me?

**GARRICK**: Things can hurt anyone. Even people made of shadow and starlight.

*Nyx considers this. Their eyes dim slightly.*

**NYX**: I don't like that. In the other place, nothing could hurt because there was nothing to hurt *with*. Here, everything can be a weapon. Even memories.

**GARRICK**: Especially memories.

**NYX**: *(Scooting slightly closer to Garrick.)* Can I sit next to you? Your sadness is quieter when I'm close. I don't know why.

**GARRICK**: *(Voice rough.)* ...Yeah. You can sit next to me.

*Nyx settles against Garrick's side. He doesn't put his arm around them -- that would be too much, too soon, too intimate for a man this careful with tenderness. But he adjusts his shield to block the wind from their direction.*

*Nyx's starfield eyes slowly dim to a soft, gentle glow. Not sleeping. But resting.*

---

## End of Chapter 6

**Chapter Hook**: The party is four, heading south toward the Crystalline Steppes and Prismfall. Nyx raises new questions about the nature of consciousness and the Hollows. Their ability to sense things about people -- Garrick's grief, Kael's inner "loudness," the voices in the Hollows -- suggests they're connected to the Convergence in ways nobody understands yet. Ahead: Prismfall, faction politics, and Lyra's next fragment in the Crystal Canyon.

**Emotional Summary**: The chapter is the game's first comedic peak -- Nyx's encounters with butterflies, bread, and shadows are genuinely funny -- but the humor has depth. Every funny moment is also a moment of first experience, of consciousness encountering reality for the first time and finding it miraculous. The debate about what Nyx is grounds the comedy in real philosophical questions, and Garrick's late-night scene with Nyx is the chapter's emotional heart: a grieving father and a newborn consciousness, finding that proximity to each other eases something in both of them.

**Trope Subversion**: The "mysterious powerful child" character is usually either a weapon or a prophecy. Nyx is neither -- they're a question. They don't know what they are, and nobody else does either. The party doesn't "recruit" Nyx through a quest or a trial. Nyx follows them because Kael is interesting, and they stay because the world is full of butterflies.

**Foreshadowing Planted**:
- Nyx hearing Kael as "loud" and "shaped like where I'm from" (Kael is a Convergence fragment)
- The voices in the Hollows -- "millions, all echoing, none listening" (the Convergence fragmented)
- Nyx's connection to emotions and ability to read people (Echo addiction subplot, Act II)
- "Can I eat your bad dreams?" (Nyx's later ability to absorb/merge with Echoes)
- Nyx born from the desire for something new (choosing selfhood theme, Act III)
