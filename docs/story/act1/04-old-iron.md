# Chapter 4: Old Iron

**Location**: Roothollow + nearby shrine, Verdant Tangle
**Party**: Kael, Iris -> Kael, Iris, Garrick
**Estimated Playtime**: 45-55 minutes
**Emotional Arc**: Routine -> surprise -> conflict -> quiet understanding

Kael and Iris return to Roothollow to resupply before heading into the Overgrown Capital. They find a stranger in the village -- an old man in heavy plate armor, carrying a shield with a scratched-out emblem, asking about purification shrines. Garrick Thorne is everything Iris feared when she saw the armor: ex-military, religious background, the kind of person who'd have hunted Echo hunters in another life. But Garrick is running from his past, not toward it. The chapter is about first impressions being wrong, about the weight people carry, and about the quiet moment when someone decides to trust a stranger.

## Scene 1: Return to Roothollow

**Location**: Roothollow, Mid-Level market
**Party**: Kael, Iris
**Time**: Morning, clear skies
**Gameplay Context**: Town hub, resupply, NPC dialogue changes
**Estimated Duration**: 8-10 minutes

### Setting

Roothollow, but through Iris's eyes. She looks up at the tree-trunk architecture with an engineer's appreciation and a city-dweller's disorientation. Everything is smaller and more organic than she's used to.

### Arrival

*Kael and Iris cross the final rope bridge into Roothollow. Iris pauses at the bridge's midpoint, looking down.*

**IRIS**: The whole village is in trees.

**KAEL**: Yeah.

**IRIS**: *Living* trees.

**KAEL**: They've been here longer than the village. We just hollowed out rooms inside them and called it home.

**IRIS**: Gearhaven is built on rock. Everything is steel and concrete. This is...

*She looks at a child running across a platform, trailing a homemade kite.*

**IRIS**: ...actually nice. Don't tell anyone I said that.

### NPC Dialogue: Roothollow (Updated)

> NPCs react to Iris's presence and to Kael being away for two days.

**MAEVE (Shopkeeper)**:
- "Kael! You've been gone two days without a word, and you come back with a woman in military armor. I've got questions."
- **KAEL**: "It's a long story, Maeve."
- "It always is with you. Well, she's welcome to browse. I've got some repair kits that might fit that arm of hers."
- *To Iris*: "You hungry? You look hungry. Here -- on the house. Any friend of Kael's gets one free meal. After that, you pay like everyone else."

**OLD WICK (Echo Hunter, retired)**:
- *Staring at Iris's armor*: "Initiative engineering. Stripped insignias. Either she's a deserter or she's undercover. Which is it?"
- **KAEL**: "She's a friend, Wick."
- "Didn't ask if she was a friend. Asked what she is."
- **IRIS**: "Both. A deserter and a friend. The two aren't mutually exclusive."
- *Wick grunts*: "Fair enough. Welcome to Roothollow, deserter. Don't touch my stuff."

**TOMAS (Neighbor)**:
- "There's a stranger in town. Big fellow. Came in yesterday evening, asked Elder Morin about purification shrines. Morin sent him to the spring shrine south of here."
- "He's polite, I'll give him that. Said 'sir' and 'ma'am' to everyone. But he's carrying a shield the size of a door and he's got that look."
- **KAEL**: "What look?"
- "The look of a man who's been walking a long time and doesn't know when to stop."

**YARA (Child)**:
- "Kael! There's a big man at the shrine! He's got armor! Is he a knight?"
- **KAEL**: "I don't know, Yara. Maybe."
- "If he's a knight, does he have a horse? I want to see a horse."
- **IRIS**: *(Aside to Kael.)* "I like this kid."

**PETRA (Cook)**:
- "The big man wouldn't eat. I offered him three times. He just shook his head and kept walking south. Some people carry their hunger different."

### Gameplay Note

> Player can resupply at Maeve's shop (new items available: Forest Remedy, Crystal Wick -- Iris can now buy basic repair components). The fragment tracker pulses faintly toward the Overgrown Capital (southeast). But the game also has a marker for the mysterious stranger at the shrine.

## Scene 2: The Shrine

**Location**: Spring Shrine, south of Roothollow
**Party**: Kael, Iris
**Time**: Late morning
**Gameplay Context**: Story scene, Garrick's introduction
**Estimated Duration**: 8-10 minutes

### Setting

A natural spring in a grotto of ancient roots, where clean water pools around a moss-covered stone altar. Crystal growths here are old and gentle -- soft blue light, no aggressive energy. Locals use it for reflection and small rituals. It's quiet. Peaceful. The kind of place where even the forest seems to hold its breath.

And in the middle of it, a man who doesn't match.

### Finding Garrick

*Kael and Iris follow the path south. Iris has her hand near her sidearm -- new people mean potential threats, and she hasn't survived two weeks of running by being relaxed.*

*The shrine comes into view. At its center, kneeling on the stone beside the spring, is a man built like a furnace. Sixty years old, at least. Barrel-chested, arms thick with muscle and scar tissue -- burn scars, the kind you get from prolonged exposure to extreme heat. Gray beard and hair, both tied back. He's wearing plate armor made of a dull, dark metal that absorbs light rather than reflecting it.*

*His shield leans against the altar. It's enormous -- the size of a small table. And on its face, an emblem has been aggressively scratched out. Deep gouges in the metal, like someone attacked the symbol with a knife, repeatedly, until it was unrecognizable.*

*But Iris recognizes the shape underneath.*

**IRIS**: *(Grabbing Kael's arm, pulling them behind a tree. Hissing.)* Shepherd.

**KAEL**: What?

**IRIS**: That shield. The scratched-out emblem. That's the Shepherds of Silence crest underneath. He's a Shepherd.

**KAEL**: *Was* a Shepherd. He scratched it out.

**IRIS**: Or he's undercover. Shepherds are everywhere. They send agents into communities to identify crystal users and--

**KAEL**: Iris. He's kneeling at a spring shrine. Alone. He asked Morin for directions.

**IRIS**: Kael, the Shepherds are fanatics. They burn people who use Resonance technology. They'd burn *me* for this arm.

**KAEL**: Then let's go talk to him and find out which kind he is.

**IRIS**: That's the worst tactical assessment I've ever heard.

**KAEL**: Probably.

*Kael steps out from behind the tree. Walks toward the shrine. Iris follows, cursing under her breath, prosthetic arm shifted to weapon configuration.*

### Meeting

*The man at the shrine doesn't look up as they approach. He's not praying -- his eyes are open, looking at the water. His hands rest on his knees. He looks like a mountain that decided to sit down.*

**KAEL**: Excuse me. The villagers said someone was using the shrine. Just wanted to make sure everything's okay.

*Garrick looks up. His eyes are gentle -- shockingly so for a face that weathered. Gray-green, patient, carrying something heavy.*

**GARRICK**: Your shrine. Your village?

**KAEL**: More or less. I'm Kael.

*Garrick nods. His gaze moves to Iris. Takes in the armor. The prosthetic. The hand positioned near the sidearm. He doesn't react.*

**GARRICK**: The woman with you is afraid of me.

**IRIS**: I'm not afraid. I'm cautious. There's a difference.

**GARRICK**: ...Fair.

*He stands. Slowly. Everything about him is slow and deliberate, like each movement is considered before it happens. Standing, he's not much taller than Iris, but wider, denser.*

**GARRICK**: My name is Garrick Thorne. I was a Shield-Bearer for the Shepherds of Silence. I left. A long time ago.

*He looks at his shield. The gouged-out emblem.*

**GARRICK**: I came here looking for a purification spring. There used to be dozens in the Tangle. Before the crystal growth thickened. Your elder said this was the last one still flowing.

**KAEL**: Purification for what?

*Garrick holds up his hands. Burn scars cover both forearms -- but among the scars, barely visible, thin lines of crystal run under the skin. Like veins. Faintly luminous.*

**GARRICK**: Crystal corruption. Slow. From years of handling contaminated Resonance materials during purges. The springs used to slow the progression.

**IRIS**: *(Her combat stance relaxing slightly.)* You've got crystal veining. That's... advanced. How long?

**GARRICK**: Decades. It doesn't spread fast. But it spreads.

*He kneels again at the spring. Puts his hands in the water. The crystal lines in his skin glow brighter for a moment, then dim.*

**GARRICK**: This spring is weak. Too much crystal growth in the area, drawing off the purification energy. It's barely slowing the progression anymore.

*He withdraws his hands. Dries them on his armor.*

**GARRICK**: I'll move on. There may be others. Further south, in the Steppes. I apologize for intruding.

**KAEL**: You're not intruding. Stay as long as you need.

**IRIS**: Kael--

**KAEL**: He's sick, Iris. And he's alone. And if the spring isn't helping, he's got nowhere to go.

*Garrick looks at Kael. Something moves behind his eyes -- surprise, maybe, at being defended by a stranger.*

**GARRICK**: The woman is right to be wary. I was a Shepherd. I did things under that banner that I can't undo.

**IRIS**: Like what?

*Long pause. Garrick looks at the water.*

**GARRICK**: ...Burned villages. Destroyed crystal caches. Forced communities to abandon Resonance technology under threat of violence. Told myself it was for the greater good. That we were saving souls from corruption.

*The silence is absolute. Even the spring seems to quiet.*

**GARRICK**: I stopped believing that eleven years ago. Left the order. Scratched the crest off my shield. Walked. Kept walking.

**IRIS**: Why did you stop believing?

*Garrick goes completely still. His eyes don't close, but something behind them shuts.*

**GARRICK**: ...Not ready to answer that. Not yet.

[SILENCE -- The spring murmurs. A bird calls from the canopy. Iris's prosthetic hand uncurls from its weapon position.]

**KAEL**: You can stay in Roothollow. For a few days, at least. Morin won't turn away someone who's sick.

**GARRICK**: I don't need charity.

**KAEL**: It's not charity. It's a village. People here help each other. That's how it works.

*Garrick looks at Kael for a long moment.*

**GARRICK**: ...You're very young to be this stubborn.

**KAEL**: I'm twenty-four. And you should try my cooking before you make any decisions.

**GARRICK**: Is your cooking good?

**KAEL**: Absolutely not. But Petra's is, and she'll feed you for free if you tell her you like her honey cakes.

*The smallest shift in Garrick's expression. Not quite a smile. The ghost of one.*

**GARRICK**: Honey cakes.

**KAEL**: They're incredible.

## Scene 3: The Elder's Opinion

**Location**: Root Level, Morin's study
**Party**: Kael, Iris
**Time**: Afternoon
**Gameplay Context**: Strategy discussion, quest planning
**Estimated Duration**: 5-6 minutes

### Setting

Morin's study. Kael and Iris sit across from him. Maps and notes on the desk, including Morin's old ruins survey.

### Planning

**MORIN**: The Overgrown Capital is eight major areas. Your tracker points to the research quarter -- that's where Lyra worked, so it makes sense her strongest fragments would be there.

**IRIS**: Based on the signal strength, I'd estimate two more fragments within the ruins proper. Possibly more beyond detection range.

**MORIN**: That's a multi-day expedition. The ruins are dangerous -- corrupted wildlife, hostile Echoes, unstable structures. And now you're telling me the Initiative has survey teams in the area.

**IRIS**: At least three active teams. They'll be using Resonance sensors. If they sweep the sector where Lyra's preserved room is...

**MORIN**: Then we have a time constraint.

*Morin looks at the map.*

**MORIN**: There's something else. The old man at the shrine -- Garrick.

**KAEL**: What about him?

**MORIN**: He's a veteran. I've seen enough veterans to recognize one. The armor, the way he moves, the scars. That man has been in more fights than you've been alive. And his crystal corruption is extensive -- he's been handling Resonance materials for years.

**IRIS**: He was a Shepherd Shield-Bearer. They do the heavy work -- breaching fortified positions, leading purges, destroying crystal caches with their bare hands. It's the most physically demanding role in the order.

**MORIN**: And the most dangerous. Crystal corruption is occupational hazard. *(Pause.)* If he's leaving the order and looking for purification, he's running out of options. The shrines are failing across the Tangle.

**KAEL**: What are you suggesting?

**MORIN**: I'm suggesting that a man with decades of combat experience, knowledge of both Shepherd tactics and Resonance systems, and a personal need that keeps him looking for crystal formations... might be useful on a trip into the Overgrown Capital.

**IRIS**: You want us to bring the Shepherd.

**MORIN**: I want you to have someone who can protect you when an Initiative squad pins you down in a ruin. Kael fights like a collector who learned swordplay from a manual. You fight well, Iris, but you're exhausted and wounded. A Shield-Bearer's entire role is keeping people alive in hostile territory.

*Iris's jaw works.*

**IRIS**: I don't trust him.

**MORIN**: You don't need to trust him. You need to survive the Overgrown Capital and retrieve Lyra's fragments before the Initiative does. Trust can come later.

## Scene 4: The Proposition

**Location**: Spring Shrine, south of Roothollow
**Party**: Kael, Iris
**Time**: Late afternoon
**Gameplay Context**: Recruitment dialogue, player choice
**Estimated Duration**: 6-8 minutes

### Setting

The shrine again. Garrick is sitting against the altar stone, eating -- Petra's honey cakes, it looks like. His shield lies across his knees. He's polishing the metal around the gouged-out emblem with a cloth, carefully, the way you'd clean a wound.

### The Ask

*Kael approaches. Iris stays a few steps back.*

**KAEL**: Garrick.

*He looks up. Sets the honey cake down.*

**GARRICK**: Kael. And the engineer.

**IRIS**: Iris.

**GARRICK**: Iris. *(A nod.)* Your elder sent you?

**KAEL**: Sort of. We have a job that's too big for two people, and Morin thinks you might be interested.

**GARRICK**: I'm not a mercenary.

**KAEL**: Neither are we. Listen -- I found something in the ruins. A Conscious Echo. A real one. A woman named Lyra who was a scientist before the Severance. She's fragmented, and her other pieces are scattered in the Overgrown Capital. We need to get them before the Reclamation Initiative does.

*Garrick's hand stops polishing.*

**GARRICK**: A Conscious Echo.

**KAEL**: I know the Shepherds believe all Echoes should be destroyed. If that's still what you believe, we've got a problem. But if you left the order because you stopped believing that...

**GARRICK**: I stopped believing a lot of things.

*He sets the shield aside.*

**GARRICK**: The Shepherds teach that all Resonance is corruption. That the Severance was punishment for mankind's arrogance. That the only path to salvation is silence -- the complete destruction of crystallized consciousness. I believed that for forty years.

*He looks at the crystal veins in his arms.*

**GARRICK**: Then I met an Echo that changed my mind. A child's laughter, trapped in a crystal. Not dangerous. Not corrupted. Just... happy. And my commanding officer ordered me to destroy it.

*Beat.*

**GARRICK**: I destroyed it. Because that's what Shield-Bearers do. And then I went back to my quarters and I sat on my bunk and I realized I'd just killed the last happy thing in a village we'd burned to the ground.

*The shrine is very quiet.*

**GARRICK**: That was eleven years ago. I walked out the next day.

**IRIS**: *(Quietly, despite herself.)* What village?

**GARRICK**: ...A place called Willowmere. South Verdant Tangle. It's not on maps anymore.

**KAEL**: Garrick, I'm sorry.

**GARRICK**: Don't be. I did it. Being sorry is my job.

*He looks at Kael.*

**GARRICK**: You said this Echo -- Lyra -- she's a person. Thinking. Feeling.

**KAEL**: She is.

**GARRICK**: And the Initiative wants to use her as fuel for a machine.

**IRIS**: That's exactly what they want.

*Garrick is still for a long time. When he speaks, it's slow, each word placed like a stone.*

**GARRICK**: I spent forty years destroying things. Crystals. Villages. People's faith. My own. Maybe it's time I protected something instead.

*He picks up his shield.*

**GARRICK**: I'll come. But I have conditions. One: I protect the group. That's my role. I put myself between you and whatever comes. That's not negotiable. Two: the Conscious Echo -- Lyra -- if she turns out to be dangerous, we deal with it together. Honestly. Three: when this is done, you help me find a working purification spring. The corruption isn't going to wait forever.

**KAEL**: Done.

**IRIS**: *(Reluctant.)* ...Done.

*Garrick nods. Stands. Puts the shield on his back.*

**GARRICK**: Then let's move. Daylight's burning.

*He pauses.*

**GARRICK**: Kael.

**KAEL**: Yeah?

**GARRICK**: The honey cakes are good. Tell Petra.

### Gameplay Note

> Garrick "Old Iron" Thorne joins the party as a full party member. His character stats, equipment, and abilities are now available. He starts with: Pre-Severance Heavy Plate Armor, Massive Shield (weapon -- defensive-oriented, can also bash), and the abilities: SHIELD WALL (reduce all party damage for 2 turns), PURIFYING STRIKE (melee attack that removes buffs from enemies), and GUARDIAN (auto-intercept lethal attacks on allies once per battle). Garrick is a tank/support character -- high Defense, low Speed, moderate Attack.

---

## Scene 5: Meeting Lyra

**Location**: Preserved room, South Ruins
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick
**Time**: Late afternoon
**Gameplay Context**: Party dynamics, Garrick reacts to Lyra
**Estimated Duration**: 5-7 minutes

### Setting

The preserved room. Crystal formations humming. Kael activates the central formation. Lyra materializes.

### Three People and a Ghost

*Garrick has not moved since Lyra appeared. He stands like a statue, shield on his back, hands at his sides. His expression is unreadable.*

**LYRA**: *(Looking at Garrick.)* You're looking at me like I'm a theological problem.

**GARRICK**: ...You are.

**LYRA**: I'm also a physicist. We're more interesting.

*Garrick's stillness breaks. A single exhale, almost a laugh.*

**GARRICK**: I was a Shepherd, ma'am. For forty years. We were taught that Echoes are echoes -- recordings, residue, not souls. You're... not what I was taught.

**LYRA**: I'd say I get that a lot, but you're actually the first ex-Shepherd I've spoken to. *(Beat.)* In three hundred years.

**GARRICK**: What do you need from us?

**LYRA**: My fragments. Scattered in the Overgrown Capital, and possibly beyond. Each one contains memories, knowledge, pieces of who I am. The more I recover, the more I remember -- including something I sealed away about the Severance. Something that mattered enough to fragment myself over.

**GARRICK**: And the Initiative wants to use you.

**LYRA**: According to Iris, yes.

*Garrick looks at his shield. The scratched-out emblem.*

**GARRICK**: The Shepherds would want to destroy you. To them, a thinking Echo is the worst kind of blasphemy.

**LYRA**: And what do you want?

*Long pause.*

**GARRICK**: To know if you're in pain.

*Lyra blinks. Of all the questions she expected, that wasn't one.*

**LYRA**: I... yes. Sometimes. The fragmentation -- it's like trying to think through gaps. Like whole rooms in your mind are dark, and you know there should be something there, but you can't reach it. It's not physical pain. It's... absence.

**GARRICK**: ...Absence. Yes. I know something about that.

*He nods. Once. Firm.*

**GARRICK**: Then we get your pieces back. Nobody should live with that kind of empty if there's a way to fill it.

---

## Camp Scene: Three Around a Fire

**Location**: Camp outside the ruins, evening
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick
**Time**: Evening, fire crackling
**Estimated Duration**: 5-6 minutes

### First Night Together

*Camp. Fire. Three people who met within the last forty-eight hours, trying to figure out how to share space.*

*Garrick is cooking. He didn't ask -- he just took the ingredients, produced a knife from somewhere, and started making stew. His movements are precise and efficient. The stew smells better than anything Kael has ever made.*

**KAEL**: You cook.

**GARRICK**: Forty years on the road. You learn or you starve.

**IRIS**: What is that? It smells like--

**GARRICK**: Traveler's stew. Root vegetables, whatever herb I could find, and a piece of that dried meat from your pack. Hope you don't mind.

**IRIS**: That was my emergency ration.

**GARRICK**: It is an emergency. Neither of you have eaten properly in days. *(He hands Iris a bowl.)* Eat. You're too thin for someone who fights as hard as you do.

*Iris takes the bowl. Tastes it. Something in her expression softens.*

**IRIS**: ...Okay. You can stay.

*They eat in silence for a while. The forest sounds fill the gaps.*

**KAEL**: So. Tomorrow we head into the Overgrown Capital. Research quarter. That's where Lyra's strongest fragment should be.

**GARRICK**: What's the terrain?

**KAEL**: Collapsed pre-Severance city. Heavy crystal growth. Hostile wildlife and Echo manifestations. Some areas are structurally unsound. It's big -- eight major sectors, and we only need the research quarter, but getting there means passing through at least two other areas.

**GARRICK**: Entry points?

**KAEL**: Main entrance through the market district -- I was there two days ago. South entrance through the residential sector. Morin's map shows a third route through the government quarter, but it's been blocked by crystal growth for years.

**IRIS**: *(Pulling out the fragment tracker.)* Signal is strongest from the northeast. That's the research quarter. We go through the market, cut through the entertainment district, and approach from the south side.

**GARRICK**: Chokepoints?

**IRIS**: At least three. The entertainment district is a bottleneck. Crystal growth has narrowed the main thoroughfare to maybe ten feet wide. Good place for an ambush.

**GARRICK**: Then I go first at the chokepoints. Shield up, eyes forward. You two watch the flanks.

*He looks at them both.*

**GARRICK**: This is what I do. Let me do it.

**KAEL**: We're not a military unit, Garrick.

**GARRICK**: No. You're two young people heading into dangerous territory with no tactical structure and more courage than sense. *(Beat.)* Which is exactly the kind of thing I used to be sent to clean up.

**IRIS**: *(Halfway between offended and amused.)* "More courage than sense."

**GARRICK**: Take it as a compliment. Sense keeps you safe. Courage gets things done.

*Kael looks at this: a deserter engineer and an ex-zealot soldier, sharing stew beside a fire in the forest, planning a dungeon run to save a three-hundred-year-old ghost.*

**KAEL**: *(To themselves, a murmur.)* This is my life now.

**GARRICK**: What?

**KAEL**: Nothing. The stew's good.

### NPC Dialogue: Garrick Camp Conversation (Optional)

> If the player talks to Garrick at camp:

**GARRICK** *(about the shield)*: I've carried this shield for thirty-six years. It's pre-Severance alloy -- they don't make metal like this anymore. I should have left it when I left the order, but... it saved my life more times than I can count. Throwing it away felt like throwing away the person who survived.

*He runs his thumb over the gouged-out emblem.*

"I scratched the crest off. But the metal remembers the shape, if you look close enough. Scars don't really go away. You just learn to live with what they used to be."

**GARRICK** *(about Kael)*: You remind me of someone. *(He doesn't say who.)* Too kind for the world you live in. Don't let anyone tell you that's a weakness. Kindness is the hardest thing to keep alive in a place like this.

**GARRICK** *(about Iris)*: She's angry. Good. Anger with direction is a powerful thing. Anger without direction is just fire looking for something to burn. Keep her pointed at something that deserves it.

---

## End of Chapter 4

**Chapter Hook**: The party of three is assembled and heading into the Overgrown Capital -- the game's first major dungeon. Garrick brings protection and experience, but also a past that weighs on him. The Initiative's survey teams are somewhere in the forest. And deep in the ruins, Lyra's fragments are waiting.

**Emotional Summary**: The chapter works as a character study. Garrick's introduction subverts expectations -- he's the "enemy faction member" who turned out to be the most earnest, protective person in the room. His interaction with Lyra is the emotional peak: a man who spent decades destroying Echoes, asking the first Conscious Echo he's met if she's in pain. Iris's distrust is warranted but softened by Garrick's transparent guilt and practical usefulness. The camp scene establishes the party's dynamic: Kael the emotional center, Iris the tactical brain, Garrick the steady anchor.

**Trope Subversion**: The "gruff warrior joins party" scene. Garrick doesn't prove himself through a test of strength or by saving someone in battle. He proves himself by cooking dinner and asking the right question. The recruitment isn't about combat capability -- it's about character.

**Foreshadowing Planted**:
- Garrick's daughter (the unspoken "someone" Kael reminds him of, plus "not ready to answer" about why he left)
- Crystal corruption as ticking clock (Garrick needs purification -- connects to larger world instability)
- The village of Willowmere (destroyed by Shepherds -- may appear as Echo location)
- Garrick's knowledge of Shepherd tactics (useful when Shepherds become antagonists in Ch 7)
- "Nobody should live with that kind of empty" (thematic echo of Kael's own emptiness)
