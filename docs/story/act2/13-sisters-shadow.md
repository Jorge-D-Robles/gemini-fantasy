# Chapter 13: Sister's Shadow

**Act**: II — The Weight of Echoes
**Estimated Playtime**: 55-65 minutes
**Party**: Kael, Lyra, Iris, Garrick, Nyx, Cipher; Sienna joins end of chapter
**Locations**: Mountain pass, Initiative Research Station Theta, surrounding wilderness
**Emotional Arc**: Tension → infiltration → horror → defection → uneasy acceptance

**Chapter Summary**: En route to the Cindral Wastes, the party discovers an Initiative research station built into the mountainside — Station Theta, one of several satellite labs supporting the Resonance Cage project. Cipher detects a distress signal from inside: someone is trying to get out. That someone is Dr. Sienna Vex, the Director's sister and the Initiative's former chief Resonance scientist, who has finally seen enough to break. The infiltration reveals the true human cost of the Cage project — living test subjects reduced to barely conscious power cells — and forces Sienna to confront what her research has done. She defects, bringing critical knowledge of the Cage's design and weaknesses. But trust is not a thing she earns easily, least of all from Iris.

**JRPG Trope Subverted**: The "scientist who was innocent all along." Sienna isn't innocent. She knew what she was doing for years. Her defection isn't a moment of realization — it's the culmination of years of denial finally cracking. She doesn't deserve forgiveness, and the story doesn't give it to her cheaply.

## Scene 1: The Signal

**Location**: Mountain pass between Ironcoast and Cindral Wastes
**Party**: Kael, Lyra, Iris, Garrick, Nyx, Cipher
**Time**: Midday. High altitude. Thin air. Wind.
**Gameplay Context**: Overworld travel between chapters. Random encounters with mountain wildlife.
**Estimated Duration**: 5 minutes

### Setting

The smuggler's route cuts through mountains that form the spine between Ironcoast and the northern wastes. Scrub pine. Loose rock. The air is thin enough that Garrick wheezes on the steeper climbs, though he'd cut his own tongue out before admitting it. Below, Gearhaven is a smear of smoke on the western horizon. Ahead, the mountains turn red-brown as volcanic soil takes over.

### Detection

*The party rests at a switchback. Cipher has their visor down, as usual, scanning.*

**CIPHER**: That's wrong.

**IRIS**: What's wrong?

**CIPHER**: There's a signal. Encrypted Initiative frequency. Coming from — *they point northeast* — two kilometers that way. Inside the mountain.

**KAEL**: An outpost?

**CIPHER**: No. Bigger. I'm reading at least a dozen power signatures, heavy Resonance shielding, and... a broadcast. Someone inside is trying to transmit on an emergency frequency. Initiative emergency frequency, but the signal's being jammed from inside the facility. Which means someone is trying to send a message that the facility doesn't want sent.

**IRIS**: A facility in the mountains that's jamming its own emergency broadcasts. That's a black site.

**GARRICK**: Shepherd intelligence used to track these. Initiative runs at least a dozen classified research stations outside Federation territory. Places where oversight can't reach.

**CIPHER**: The signal... *they cock their head* ...it's repeating. Same message, over and over. Encoded. Give me a second.

*They press their hand against a rock face. The tattoos flare. Their eyes go unfocused.*

**CIPHER**: Got it. It's a name. "Sienna Vex. Requesting extraction. Protocol Nine. Sienna Vex. Requesting extraction. Protocol Nine."

*Silence.*

**IRIS**: Sienna Vex. The Director's sister.

**KAEL**: What's Protocol Nine?

**IRIS**: *quiet* Defection. It's the Initiative code for "I want out and I'll trade intelligence for protection." I've never actually heard someone use it.

**LYRA**: If Sienna Vex is trying to defect... she could have information about the Resonance Cage that Cipher's surveillance couldn't access. Internal design documents. Weakness analysis. The things they keep off the network.

**CIPHER**: She's also the person who invented Resonance battery technology. The technique that turns people into living power cells. That's her research. Her name is on the papers.

*The party looks at each other.*

### Choice: Approach the Station

**[A] Investigate the station and attempt to extract Sienna**
> Leads to full infiltration sequence. Potential ally gained. High risk.

**[B] Ignore the signal and continue north**
> Skip infiltration. Sienna does not join the party in this playthrough. Lose access to Cage schematics. (Significantly harder Act III.)

---

## Scene 2: Station Theta

**Location**: Exterior of Initiative Research Station Theta, mountainside
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx, Cipher (Lyra stays hidden outside — too detectable)
**Time**: Afternoon. Wind picking up. Clouds gathering.
**Gameplay Context**: Pre-infiltration reconnaissance.
**Estimated Duration**: 4 minutes

### Setting

Station Theta is built into a cliff face. From outside, it looks like a mine entrance — reinforced door, ventilation shafts poking from the rock, a small landing pad for aerial transport. Two guards patrol outside in Initiative standard armor. Security cameras sweep the approach.

But the cameras aren't moving. One guard is sitting. The other is leaning against the wall. Something is wrong inside, and the security has gone lax.

### Approach

*Cipher scans from behind a boulder.*

**CIPHER**: Two guards external. Camera system is... down? No, not down. Running on backup power. The main reactor is fluctuating. Something's happening inside.

**IRIS**: Staffing for a station this size should be thirty to forty personnel. I'm only seeing two guards. No patrol pattern. No shift change.

**GARRICK**: They look tired.

**IRIS**: They look scared.

*Kael studies the entrance.*

**KAEL**: Can you get us in without a fight?

**CIPHER**: Camera loop — thirty seconds to get past the entrance. The door lock is electronic. Give me physical contact and I'll have it open in... *they calculate* ...four seconds.

**IRIS**: And the guards?

**GARRICK**: Leave them to me.

*He steps out from cover. The guards reach for weapons.*

**GARRICK**: Easy. I'm not armed. *He is extremely armed, but he holds his hands up.* I'm a traveler. My party's caravan broke down on the pass. We need water and directions.

**GUARD 1**: This is a restricted facility. Move along.

**GARRICK**: Son, I've been walking all day and I'm sixty years old. A glass of water isn't classified.

*While Garrick holds their attention — and he's very good at being large, slow, and unthreatening — Cipher loops the cameras, Iris disables the exterior alarm from the junction box, and Kael and Nyx slip through the door Cipher opened.*

*Four seconds, just like Cipher said.*

### Gameplay Note

> Infiltration dungeon begins. Station Theta has four sections: Administrative Wing, Laboratory Wing, Containment Wing, and Reactor Core. Mix of stealth and combat. Enemies: Initiative Security (alert but undermanned), Automated Turrets (disabled by Cipher), and in the deeper sections — Resonance Aberrations (the result of failed experiments). Key mechanic: Stealth is optional but rewarded — each section cleared without alert gives a bonus (better loot, additional lore, easier boss).

---

## Scene 3: What They Built Here

**Location**: Station Theta — Administrative Wing
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx, Cipher
**Time**: Inside. Fluorescent lighting. Hum of climate control.
**Gameplay Context**: First dungeon section. Light exploration and stealth.
**Estimated Duration**: 6 minutes (gameplay + story)

### Setting

The admin wing is offices and meeting rooms. Papers on desks. Coffee mugs still warm. But the chairs are empty. A half-eaten meal congeals on a conference table. Wherever the staff went, they left in a hurry — or were called away.

On a whiteboard in the main office, someone has written: "CONTAINMENT BREACH — ALL NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL TO REACTOR LEVEL."

### Discovery

*Cipher pulls data from a terminal.*

**CIPHER**: Station Theta. Classified as "Resonance Applications Research." Official purpose: developing new crystal technology for civilian use. Actual purpose—

*They swipe through files. Their face changes.*

**CIPHER**: Resonance battery prototyping. This is where they do it. Where they take people and...

*They pull off the visor.*

**CIPHER**: There are personnel files here. The "test subjects." They have names. Ages. Former occupations. A teacher. A dock worker. A fourteen-year-old apprentice blacksmith.

**IRIS**: *tightly* I know what the files look like, Cipher.

**CIPHER**: Right. You would.

**KAEL**: Where's Sienna?

**CIPHER**: The signal originates from the laboratory wing. Next section over. But the containment wing is between us and her, and containment is where they keep the... the subjects.

*Nyx has been very quiet. When they speak, their voice doesn't have its usual curiosity. It's flat.*

**NYX**: I can feel them. The people in the walls. They're not dead. They're not alive. They're... playing. Like a song stuck on one note.

*Everyone looks at Nyx.*

**NYX**: It's the worst sound I've ever heard.

### Gameplay Note

> Continue through Administrative Wing. Loot: Initiative research logs (Story Echoes), keycards for deeper access, medical supplies. One optional office contains a personal terminal with messages between Sienna and Director Vex — increasingly heated arguments about "ethical boundaries."

---

## Scene 4: The Containment Wing

**Location**: Station Theta — Containment Wing
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx, Cipher
**Time**: Inside. The lights flicker. The hum is different here — organic.
**Gameplay Context**: The horror section. Unavoidable. No random encounters — scripted.
**Estimated Duration**: 8 minutes

### Setting

The containment wing is a long corridor with glass-fronted cells on both sides. Each cell contains a person-shaped crystal formation — translucent, faintly pulsing, with a human figure visible inside. Not statues. The figures move. Slowly. Breathing. Eyes open but seeing nothing.

There are twelve cells. Twelve people. Each one connected by crystal conduits to a central power relay.

This is what the Resonance Cage will look like at full scale. These are the prototypes.

### Walking Through

*The party enters. Nobody speaks for several steps. The only sound is the soft pulse of the crystal formations and the distant hum of the reactor.*

*Kael stops at the first cell. Inside, a man — maybe thirty — floats in a crystal cocoon. His eyes are open. His mouth moves, but no sound comes out. The conduit connecting him to the relay pulses with each word he tries to say.*

**KAEL**: Can they hear us?

**CIPHER**: *scanning, voice strained* Partial consciousness. They're aware on some level. The crystal matrix is using their Resonance output as fuel while keeping them in a semi-conscious state. Just aware enough to generate emotional energy. Not aware enough to...

*They can't finish.*

**IRIS**: To resist.

*She's standing in front of another cell. This one holds a younger person. Her prosthetic hand pressed flat against the glass.*

**IRIS**: Subject seventeen. *Her voice is a wire pulled too tight.* When I was in the Initiative, my unit transported subjects to facilities like this. They told us it was voluntary. Rehabilitation. "Crystal therapy." I believed it for three years. I believed it until I walked past a loading dock and saw them — the subjects. In restraints. Screaming.

*She pulls her hand back. The metal fingers leave marks on the glass.*

**IRIS**: I left that night. I've told myself for two years that leaving was enough. That I'd done my part by refusing to participate.

*She turns to face the group.*

**IRIS**: It wasn't enough. Standing in this hallway, it will never be enough.

**GARRICK**: ...Iris.

**IRIS**: Don't. I'm fine. Let's find Sienna and get these people out.

**CIPHER**: I'm not sure we can get them out. The crystal integration is deep. Pulling them out without a controlled extraction process could—

**IRIS**: Could what.

**CIPHER**: Kill them.

*Silence.*

**KAEL**: Sienna would know. She designed this. If anyone can reverse it—

**IRIS**: If she *will* reverse it. She built this, Kael. This was her life's work.

### Gameplay Note

> No combat in the containment wing. This is a narrative gauntlet. Each cell has an optional interaction — press A to read the subject's file. Some are heartbreaking. Some are worse. At the end of the corridor, a locked door leads to the laboratory wing. Cipher opens it.

---

## Scene 5: Sienna

**Location**: Station Theta — Laboratory Wing, main lab
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx, Cipher
**Time**: Inside. Emergency lighting — the lab is on backup power.
**Gameplay Context**: Meeting Sienna. No combat.
**Estimated Duration**: 10 minutes

### Setting

The main lab is a disaster. Equipment overturned. Crystal samples shattered on the floor. A workstation still runs, displaying what looks like extraction protocols — the process for safely removing a subject from a Resonance battery. Someone was working on this when the containment breach happened.

Sienna Vex stands at the far end of the lab, behind a barricade of overturned tables. She's pointing a Resonance disruptor pistol at the door. She looks exactly like the personnel files describe: tall, thin, angular features, hair pulled back, glasses, white lab coat. But the files don't capture the exhaustion. The trembling hands. The look of someone who hasn't slept in days.

### First Words

*Sienna sees the party. The disruptor doesn't waver.*

**SIENNA**: Stop. Identify yourselves.

**IRIS**: Former Sergeant Iris Mantle, Initiative Special Operations. Retired.

**SIENNA**: Retired isn't the word on your file.

**IRIS**: My file can go to hell. We picked up your signal. Protocol Nine.

*Sienna's gun hand shakes harder.*

**SIENNA**: That signal has been broadcasting for forty-six hours. I was beginning to think nobody was listening.

**KAEL**: We're here. Can you put the gun down?

**SIENNA**: That depends. Are you with my brother?

**KAEL**: No.

**SIENNA**: Are you with the Shepherds?

**KAEL**: No.

**SIENNA**: Then who—

*She sees Kael's palms. The crystalline scarring. Her scientific mind kicks in despite everything.*

**SIENNA**: Resonance stigmata. Consistent with high-frequency Anchor manifestation. You're... you're one of the Anchors Vex has been hunting.

**KAEL**: My name is Kael. And yes.

*Sienna lowers the gun. Not because she trusts them. Because she's too tired to hold it up.*

**SIENNA**: I've spent twelve years building technology to harvest people like you. I've written the specifications for the Cage that would drain your consciousness indefinitely. I've — *her voice breaks and reconstitutes, clinical again* — I've personally overseen the conversion of thirty-seven individuals into Resonance batteries. Eleven of them are in the containment wing down the hall.

*She sets the gun on the table.*

**SIENNA**: I'm telling you this so there's no ambiguity. I am not a good person who got caught up in something bad. I am a bad person who did bad things because I believed the science justified the suffering. "The sub — the *people*. The people I used."

*She catches herself. The self-correction is visible — a flinch.*

**IRIS**: You called them subjects.

**SIENNA**: I've been calling them subjects for twelve years. It takes time to stop. I'm working on it.

**IRIS**: How comforting for them.

*The room could freeze.*

**KAEL**: What changed? Why now?

**SIENNA**: Three days ago, my brother sent a directive. Phase Three of the Cage project. The current battery subjects — the ones in containment — they're to be disposed of. "Replaced with higher-yield assets." That's his language. Disposed of. Like equipment.

*Her hands shake harder. She puts them flat on the table to steady them.*

**SIENNA**: I've justified a great deal. I told myself the subjects were volunteers. They weren't. I told myself the process was reversible. It's difficult, possibly impossible. I told myself it was for the greater good. But disposing of human beings because their power output isn't sufficient? That's not science. That's not even pragmatism. That's — my brother doesn't see them as people anymore. And I realized that for twelve years, neither did I.

### Iris and Sienna

*Iris steps closer. Close enough that Sienna can see the prosthetic arm — military issue, Initiative-made.*

**IRIS**: I transported people to labs like this one. I stood outside doors like these and told myself I didn't know what was happening on the other side. When I found out, I ran. I didn't save anyone. I didn't shut anything down. I ran.

*Beat.*

**IRIS**: So when I say you don't get my forgiveness — understand it's because I haven't figured out how to forgive myself either.

*Sienna meets her eyes.*

**SIENNA**: I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm asking for the chance to undo what I can.

**GARRICK**: Can you free the people in containment?

**SIENNA**: I was working on an extraction protocol when the containment systems failed. One of the sub — *she corrects again* — one of the patients destabilized. Their crystal matrix ruptured and released a Resonance burst that corrupted the facility's automated systems. The security drones went haywire. Most of the staff evacuated. I stayed to finish the extraction protocol.

**CIPHER**: Did you finish it?

**SIENNA**: In theory. It hasn't been tested. The extraction would need to be performed individually, with precisely calibrated Resonance frequencies. One mistake and the patient dies.

**KAEL**: How long per person?

**SIENNA**: Hours. Maybe a full day for the worst cases.

*Twelve subjects. Twelve days minimum, in a failing facility with corrupted security systems and the Initiative possibly sending a response team.*

### Choice: The Subjects

**[A] Attempt to free the subjects now (dangerous, time-consuming)**
> Sienna begins extraction process. The party defends the containment wing from corrupted drones for multiple rounds. Two subjects are successfully freed (the others need too long — party must retreat). Freed subjects provide unique Story Echoes and a powerful Combat Echo. Significant moral weight.

**[B] Take Sienna's data and come back later with more resources**
> Copy the extraction protocol. Leave the subjects. Faster, safer. The subjects survive in stasis. Can return in a later chapter to complete extractions. Less immediate payoff but strategically sound.

**[C] Destroy the facility to prevent the Initiative from continuing (Iris suggests this)**
> Overload the reactor. All subjects die but so does the research. No extraction data preserved. The Initiative loses a facility. Darkest option — Sienna objects violently. Affects her bond with the party permanently.

---

## Scene 6: The Escape

**Location**: Station Theta — various (combat through corrupted security back to entrance)
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx, Cipher, Sienna (temporary party member)
**Time**: The facility is falling apart. Alarms. Sparking conduits. Crystal growth spreading.
**Gameplay Context**: Dungeon escape sequence. Sienna as temporary ally (uses Resonance Disruptor abilities — debuffs, enemy analysis).
**Estimated Duration**: 15 minutes

### Setting

Whatever containment breach happened three days ago has been getting worse. Crystal growth has spread from the reactor level into the corridors. Automated security — drones, turrets, lockdown doors — has gone haywire, attacking everything that moves. The facility is dying.

### Running

*The party moves through collapsing corridors. Cipher hacks doors. Iris provides covering fire. Garrick takes point, shield raised.*

*Sienna runs in a way that suggests she's never had to run from anything in her life — awkward, stumbling, lab coat catching on debris.*

**CIPHER**: Left! Go left! The right corridor is — *they touch a wall, reading the systems* — it's flooded with raw Resonance. We'd be Hollow in thirty seconds.

*They go left. A security drone drops from the ceiling.*

**IRIS**: Contact!

### Gameplay Note

> Running battle through the facility. Three encounters: Corrupted Security Drones (2), Resonance Aberration (a failed experiment that broke loose — mini-boss), and a final gauntlet of automated turrets in the entrance corridor. Sienna provides debuff support — "Resonance Disrupt" (lowers enemy attack/defense) and "Weakness Scan" (reveals vulnerabilities). She has low HP and must be protected.

> Environmental hazards: spreading crystal growth (damages on contact), sparking power conduits (area damage), and collapsing ceiling sections (timed dodges).

---

## Scene 7: Outside

**Location**: Mountain pass, outside Station Theta
**Party**: Kael, Lyra, Iris, Garrick, Nyx, Cipher, Sienna
**Time**: Dusk. The facility entrance behind them sparks and groans. Won't be operational much longer.
**Gameplay Context**: Post-dungeon. Sienna officially joins.
**Estimated Duration**: 7 minutes

### Setting

Fresh air. Cold mountain wind. The sky is turning purple over the volcanic peaks to the north. Lyra manifests near the entrance, drawn by the Resonance energy leaking from the facility. She and Sienna see each other.

Something passes between them — recognition? Understanding? Two scientists separated by three centuries, both architects of catastrophe.

### Breathing

*Sienna sits on a rock. Her lab coat is torn. Her glasses are cracked. Her hands haven't stopped shaking.*

*Kael offers her a canteen. She stares at it like she's forgotten what water is, then drinks.*

**SIENNA**: Thank you.

**KAEL**: Are you okay?

**SIENNA**: No. I am definitively not okay. I've been not okay for approximately twelve years, and the only thing that's changed is that I've stopped pretending otherwise.

*Lyra drifts closer.*

**LYRA**: Dr. Vex.

**SIENNA**: *looking up, sharp* You're the Conscious Echo. Lyra. Pre-Severance era.

**LYRA**: Yes.

**SIENNA**: The theoretical models say you shouldn't exist.

**LYRA**: So I've been told. Repeatedly.

**SIENNA**: And yet you persist. *She studies Lyra with the same intensity she probably studied her test subjects.* Your Resonance signature is remarkably coherent for a three-hundred-year-old fragment. The energy requirements alone — unless you have an internal stabilization mechanism that our models don't account for.

**LYRA**: You have your brother's analytical mind.

*Sienna goes rigid.*

**SIENNA**: Don't compare me to him.

**LYRA**: I meant it as an observation, not an insult. You both see systems where others see chaos. The difference is what you choose to do with that vision.

*Sienna looks away. Down at her hands — still shaking.*

**SIENNA**: What I chose to do was build a machine that eats people.

**LYRA**: Yes. And now you're choosing something else. That's not redemption. But it's a start.

### The Data

*Cipher approaches.*

**CIPHER**: Dr. Vex. I need everything you have on the Resonance Cage. Design specs, power requirements, vulnerabilities, timeline. Everything.

**SIENNA**: You're the other Anchor. The Initiative calls you "Ghost." They've been hunting you for years.

**CIPHER**: Flattering. The specs?

*Sienna pulls a data crystal from her coat pocket. Small, dense, glowing faintly.*

**SIENNA**: Complete Cage schematics. Materials inventory. Anchor integration protocols. And the extraction protocol for Resonance battery subjects — the process I was developing when the facility failed.

*She holds it out.*

**SIENNA**: This is everything I know about how to build a Cage. Which means it's also everything you need to know about how to break one.

*Cipher takes it. Their fingers touch Sienna's. A jolt — two Resonance-sensitive individuals making contact. Both flinch.*

**CIPHER**: I'll analyze this tonight.

**SIENNA**: I should review it with you. Some of the schematics use proprietary notation—

**CIPHER**: I can read Initiative notation. I've been reading your encrypted files for eight months.

**SIENNA**: You've been — *she processes this* — that was you. The data breaches. The system corruptions. That was all you?

**CIPHER**: Guilty as charged.

**SIENNA**: You've cost the Initiative approximately four hundred million credits in damages and delays.

**CIPHER**: Only four hundred? I was aiming for half a billion.

*Sienna stares at them. Then, for the first time, something that might be admiration flickers across her face.*

**SIENNA**: ...Impressive.

### Gameplay Note

> Sienna officially joins the party. Unlock her profile, equipment, and skill tree. Initial equipment: Resonance Rod (magic weapon), Lab Coat (light armor — low defense, high resistance), Data Crystal (accessory — reveals enemy Resonance levels). Starting level: party average.

> Sienna's skill tree: Resonance Analysis (debuffs/weakness exploitation), Crystal Theory (offensive Resonance magic), and Extraction Science (healing/purification). Her unique ability: "Self-Correction" — when she misses an attack, the next attack automatically hits and deals bonus damage. Thematic: she learns from mistakes.

> Bond system active for Sienna. Initial bonds: Kael D-rank, Cipher D-rank, Iris E-rank (penalty from history), all others E-rank.

## Camp Scene: The Space Between Sisters

**Location**: Mountain camp, north of Station Theta
**Party**: Full party
**Time**: Night. Stars visible between volcanic clouds. Cold enough to see breath.
**Estimated Duration**: 5 minutes

### Setting

Two fires tonight — not by design, but because Sienna set up her bedroll ten meters from everyone else and Garrick quietly built a second fire so she wouldn't freeze. She didn't thank him. She may not have noticed.

### Two Fires

*At the main fire: Kael, Iris, Garrick, Nyx. Lyra flickers nearby.*

*Iris is sharpening a knife. She doesn't need to — the blade is fine. She needs something to do with her hands.*

**GARRICK**: You're angry.

**IRIS**: I'm not angry.

**GARRICK**: You're sharpening a knife that doesn't need sharpening.

**IRIS**: Maybe I'm thorough.

**GARRICK**: Iris.

*She stops. The knife stays in her hand.*

**IRIS**: She built the batteries, Garrick. Not hypothetically. Not in a theoretical paper. She put people in crystal coffins and watched them disappear into the glow. People like the ones in that facility. People like the ones I — *she catches herself* — the ones we transported.

**GARRICK**: I know.

**IRIS**: And now she's sitting by our fire. Eating our food. Sleeping under our watch.

**GARRICK**: I burned a village once. Thought it was corrupted. Led forty Shepherds through the gates at dawn and burned everything that had crystal in it. Houses. Workshops. People.

*Iris looks at him.*

**GARRICK**: My daughter was there. Helping at the clinic. I didn't know.

*Silence.*

**GARRICK**: I'm not saying Sienna deserves forgiveness. I'm saying if this group only accepts people who've never done monstrous things, it's going to get very small.

### The Other Fire

*At Sienna's fire. Nyx drifts over — no one asked them to, and no one stopped them.*

**NYX**: Dr. Vex.

**SIENNA**: *startled* I didn't hear you approach.

**NYX**: I'm told I'm quiet. Can I sit with you?

**SIENNA**: I... yes. If you want.

*Nyx settles cross-legged by the fire. Their starfield eyes watch Sienna with open curiosity.*

**NYX**: Your hands shake.

**SIENNA**: Chronic Resonance exposure. Occupational hazard of working with crystal systems for twelve years.

**NYX**: Does it hurt?

**SIENNA**: Sometimes. The tremor is mostly a nuisance. It makes precise work difficult, which is ironic, since precise work is what caused it.

**NYX**: Can I see?

*Sienna hesitates. Then holds out her hands. Nyx takes them — gently, with the careful tenderness of someone who treats physical contact as a rare gift.*

*Nyx's starfield eyes pulse. Sienna gasps — not in pain, but in surprise. For just a moment, her hands stop shaking.*

**SIENNA**: What did you—

**NYX**: I don't know. Something in you is trying very hard to be still. I just... helped it find the quiet place.

*Sienna pulls her hands back. The tremor returns, but softer.*

**SIENNA**: That's... that shouldn't be possible without a calibrated Resonance stabilizer.

**NYX**: I don't know what that is. I just felt what you needed.

*Sienna looks at Nyx — really looks, probably for the first time.*

**SIENNA**: You're remarkable. I hope you know that.

**NYX**: I know that I like sitting by fires with people. Does that count?

**SIENNA**: ...Yes. I think it does.

### Gameplay Note

> Bond points: Garrick+Iris +1, Nyx+Sienna +2. Camp scene ends. Morning departure for Cindral Wastes. Two days of overworld travel (with random encounters) before reaching Emberhearth and Chapter 14.

## NPC Dialogue: Station Theta (Optional Exploration)

**Sienna's Personal Terminal (Admin Wing)**:
[Message from Director Vex]
"Sienna — Phase Three is non-negotiable. The current subjects have served their purpose. Their output has plateaued. We need Anchors for the final assembly. Sentiment has no place in this. Remember what we're building this for. Remember Mom and Dad. — V."

[Reply from Sienna, unsent draft]
"Vex — I remember Mom and Dad every time I look at a subject's face. That's the problem. You've stopped seeing faces. I'm not sure you see anything anymore except the Cage. What are we saving if we destroy everyone worth saving? — S."

**Research Log (Lab Wing)**:
"Subject 14 — Day 847. Resonance output stable at 3.2 terajoules per cycle. Cognitive function: minimal. Motor function: none. Subject responds to external stimuli with micro-fluctuations in crystal matrix density, suggesting residual awareness. Recommended action: maintain current protocol. Note: Subject 14 was formerly designated as Marcus Theel, age 34, occupation: elementary school teacher. I am including this personal information for completeness, not — I am including it because he deserves to be more than a number."

**Guard's Personal Log (Admin Wing)**:
"They don't tell us what's down in containment. But we hear things. Not sounds — feelings. Like being sad for no reason. Like missing someone you've never met. Whatever they're doing down there, it bleeds through the walls. I put in for transfer last week. They told me transfers from Theta aren't available. I'm beginning to think that means something."

---

## End of Chapter 13

**Chapter Hook**: Sienna has joined the party, bringing invaluable intelligence about the Resonance Cage — including how to break it. But her presence creates friction, especially with Iris, and the moral weight of what they've witnessed in Station Theta will haunt everyone. Ahead lies the Cindral Wastes and the search for the youngest, most vulnerable Anchor. The Initiative's team is already there.

**Threads Advanced**:
- Sienna recruited (with tension)
- Resonance Cage schematics obtained
- Human cost of the Cage made visceral and personal
- Iris's guilt deepened and confronted
- Garrick reveals more of his past (the village purge, his daughter)
- Sienna's self-correction speech pattern established
- Nyx's empathic abilities growing

**Foreshadowing Planted**:
- Sienna's unsent message to Vex (he's lost in the mission; she hasn't — yet)
- Lyra's "internal stabilization mechanism" — Sienna notices what Cipher noticed
- Nyx's ability to calm Sienna's tremor (Resonance empathy developing)
- The extraction protocol (will be needed later for Cage prisoners)
- "Remember Mom and Dad" — Vex and Sienna's shared loss driving them in opposite directions
