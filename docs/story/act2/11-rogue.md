# Chapter 11: Rogue

**Act**: II — The Weight of Echoes
**Estimated Playtime**: 50-60 minutes
**Party**: Kael, Lyra (NPC), Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Locations**: Wilderness camp (Verdant Tangle border), Abandoned waystation, Prismfall outskirts
**Emotional Arc**: Shell-shock → argument → fragile resolve

**Chapter Summary**: In the aftermath of their escape from the Initiative facility, the party regroups at a makeshift camp. The revelation that Kael is a Resonance Anchor — one of only three people who can stabilize or control the Convergence — has fractured the group's trust and sense of purpose. After a night of difficult conversations and a narrowly avoided Initiative patrol, the party chooses to go rogue: reject both factions, find the other two Anchors, and forge their own path. But the decision comes at a cost — they're cut off from support, hunted by everyone, and Kael is quietly terrified of what they might be.

**JRPG Trope Subverted**: The "regrouping after defeat" scene where the hero gives a rousing speech. Instead, Kael falls apart, and it's the *group* — messily, grudgingly — that holds things together.

## Scene 1: What We Carried Out

**Location**: Makeshift camp, dense woods at the Verdant Tangle border
**Party**: Kael, Lyra, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Late night, cold. Firelight. Insects and distant crystal hum.
**Gameplay Context**: Player just finished the Act I climax escape sequence. Auto-save triggered. This is the first scene of Act II.
**Estimated Duration**: 8 minutes

### Setting

A cramped clearing between mossy boulders. Someone — Garrick, probably — got a fire going, but it's small and reluctant. Iris's prosthetic arm sparks at the elbow joint where it took a hit during the escape. Nyx sits too close to the flames, their starfield eyes reflecting nothing. Lyra's form flickers badly, more translucent than she's been in weeks. Kael sits apart from the others, back against a tree, staring at their own hands.

Nobody has spoken in a while.

### The Silence

*Garrick feeds a stick into the fire. It pops. Nobody flinches — they're too tired to flinch.*

*Iris works on her arm with a small tool, movements sharp and precise. Metal on metal. She hasn't looked at Kael since they made camp.*

*Nyx tilts their head, watching the fire with the intensity of someone cataloguing a new phenomenon.*

**NYX**: Is it supposed to smell like that?

*Silence.*

**NYX**: The smoke. It smells different here than at the other camps. More like... the word is wet? But for smell.

**GARRICK**: Damp. The wood's damp.

**NYX**: Damp. *They taste the word.* That's not a good word. It doesn't feel like it sounds.

*More silence. Iris's tool slips. She swears under her breath, something Ironcoast and sharp.*

**IRIS**: The servo coupler's cracked. I need a workshop, or at minimum a soldering pick, or this arm is going to be decorative in about six hours.

**GARRICK**: Prismfall's a day south. Maybe two if we stick to back trails.

**IRIS**: And if the Initiative has people there?

**GARRICK**: They will.

*Iris nods. Keeps working. The tool slips again.*

### Kael Breaks

*Kael hasn't moved. Their hands are in their lap, palms up. The crystalline scarring on their palms catches firelight.*

**KAEL**: They knew.

*Everyone looks at them. It's the first thing Kael has said in hours.*

**KAEL**: Vex knew what I was before I did. Before any of us did. He had files, Iris. Medical charts. Growth projections. Like I was a... a crop report.

**IRIS**: Kael—

**KAEL**: A Resonance Anchor. I don't even know what that means. Not really. He said I can stabilize the Convergence. Or destabilize it. That I'm one of three people in the entire world who can touch the thing that nearly destroyed everything and just — what? Steer it?

*Their voice cracks. Not dramatically. Just a small fracture in the middle of a word.*

**KAEL**: I collect dead people's memories for a living. I can barely steer a conversation.

**LYRA**: Kael. You need to rest. Your Resonance signature is erratic, and if you don't—

**KAEL**: My Resonance signature. Right. Because I'm not a person, I'm a signature.

*Lyra fades slightly. That hurt.*

**GARRICK**: ...You're a person.

*Kael looks up at him.*

**GARRICK**: Had a sergeant once. Good man. Found out his grandmother had been Shepherd. Spent two weeks wondering if his whole life was a lie. If the faith had been in his blood all along, pulling strings he couldn't see.

*He turns the stick in the fire.*

**GARRICK**: Told him: You're what you do. Every day. Not what someone made you from.

*Beat.*

**KAEL**: And did that help?

**GARRICK**: Not even a little.

*Kael almost laughs. It comes out wrong — more like a hiccup.*

**GARRICK**: But it was true anyway.

### Nyx Asks the Wrong Question

*Nyx has been watching Kael with an intensity that would be unsettling from anyone else. From Nyx, it's just... Nyx.*

**NYX**: Kael. If you're a Resonance Anchor, and I'm a being born from the Hollows, does that make us the same kind of not-human? Or different kinds?

*Iris's tool stops moving.*

**IRIS**: Nyx. Read the room.

**NYX**: I can't read rooms. Rooms don't have text.

**IRIS**: It's an expression. It means now is not the—

**KAEL**: No. It's... it's a fair question.

*Kael looks at Nyx. For a moment, something shifts between them — two beings that aren't sure what they are, looking at each other across a small fire.*

**KAEL**: I don't know, Nyx. I honestly don't know what I am. But I think... maybe that makes us the same kind of confused?

*Nyx considers this. Their starfield eyes brighten slightly.*

**NYX**: I like that. Being confused together is better than being confused alone. I think that's what "friends" means.

*Something eases, just fractionally. Garrick's mouth twitches under his beard. Even Iris's shoulders drop a centimeter.*

### Gameplay Note

> Brief camp exploration. Player can talk to each party member for short dialogue. Kael's journal updates with Act II objectives. No combat in this scene. Save point available at the campfire.

---

## Scene 2: What We're Running From

**Location**: Same camp, pre-dawn
**Party**: Kael, Lyra, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: The gray hour before sunrise. Dew on everything. Fire's nearly dead.
**Gameplay Context**: Triggered after camp exploration and journal update.
**Estimated Duration**: 10 minutes

### Setting

The fire has burned to embers. Most of the party dozed fitfully. Garrick kept watch — he does that. Iris wakes first, as always, hand going to the knife under her bedroll before her eyes are fully open.

Lyra didn't sleep. Can't. She's been hovering near Kael, who tossed and muttered through the night, hands glowing faintly with crystalline light they can't seem to control.

### Dawn Argument

*Iris stretches, winces, tests her arm. The prosthetic responds sluggishly.*

**IRIS**: We need to move before full light. Initiative will have tracker teams out by now. Standard protocol after a containment breach is a forty-kilometer sweep grid within twenty-four hours.

**GARRICK**: You know their protocols.

**IRIS**: I wrote half of them.

*Kael sits up, looking wrecked. Dark circles. Hair flat on one side.*

**KAEL**: Where do we even go? We can't go back to Roothollow — they'll be watching it. Can't go to Prismfall without running into faction agents.

**LYRA**: We need to find the other Anchors. That much is clear. If the Initiative wants them — if the Shepherds want them dead — then those people are in danger.

**IRIS**: "Those people." We don't know who they are. We don't know where they are. We don't know if they even know what they are. We're talking about searching an entire continent while two armies hunt us.

**LYRA**: I have... fragments. Impressions. When Kael's Anchor signature manifested in the facility, I felt echoes of the others. One west. One north. I can't be more specific.

**IRIS**: "West" and "north." That narrows it down to approximately half the known world.

*Garrick stands, joints popping. He's too old for sleeping on roots and he doesn't complain about it, which somehow makes it worse.*

**GARRICK**: West is Ironcoast. North is Cindral.

**KAEL**: Gearhaven and Emberhearth.

**GARRICK**: Two cities we have no contacts in, no safe houses, no supplies for.

**IRIS**: I have contacts in Gearhaven. Not friendly ones, but contacts.

**NYX**: *perking up* I've never been to a city. Are they like forests but with more straight lines?

**IRIS**: ...Sure.

### The Real Fight

*Lyra solidifies slightly — she does this when she's trying to be taken seriously.*

**LYRA**: There's something else. Something I didn't want to say while Kael was... processing.

*Kael tenses.*

**LYRA**: The Initiative didn't just know about the Anchors. They've been building something. I caught fragments of it in the facility's Resonance network before we escaped. A device. Something designed to contain or harness the Convergence directly.

**IRIS**: A weapon?

**LYRA**: Worse. A cage.

*Silence.*

**IRIS**: Define "cage" in this context.

**LYRA**: A way to trap the Convergence — all of it, the collective consciousness of humanity — and force it into a controlled state. Indefinitely. Using the Anchors as... as power sources.

**KAEL**: So Vex didn't want to work *with* me. He wanted to use me as a battery.

**LYRA**: I'm sorry, Kael. I should have sensed it sooner. My fragmentation—

**KAEL**: Don't. Just... don't apologize for being broken. We're all broken.

*Kael stands. They're shaking, but standing.*

**KAEL**: Okay. So the Initiative wants to enslave the Convergence using us as jumper cables. The Shepherds want to destroy everything crystal-touched, which probably means destroying us too. And somewhere out there are two more people like me who have no idea what's about to hit them.

**IRIS**: That's the situation, yeah.

**KAEL**: Then we find them first.

**GARRICK**: That simple?

**KAEL**: Nothing about this is simple. But — look, I spent my whole life thinking I was just some kid who couldn't remember their past. Turns out I might be something else entirely. A Convergence fragment. An Anchor. A tool someone wants to use. And the only thing I can control right now is what I do next. So what I do next is make sure nobody else gets turned into a battery. That's... that's what I've got.

*Not a rousing speech. Kael's voice shakes through half of it. But it's real.*

**GARRICK**: ...Good enough.

**IRIS**: It's a terrible plan. I'm in.

**NYX**: Where Kael goes, I go. That's how this works, right? That's what the party dynamic is?

**KAEL**: Yeah, Nyx. That's how it works.

*Lyra drifts closer. Her translucence steadies.*

**LYRA**: West first. The Anchor in Ironcoast territory will be in the most immediate danger — the Initiative's power base is there.

**IRIS**: Gearhaven it is. *She tests her arm again. It sparks.* I really need to fix this first.

### Choice: Route to Gearhaven

The player must decide:

**[A] Take the main trade road through Prismfall (faster but riskier)**
> Faster travel, but requires navigating through a town with heavy faction presence. Triggers an encounter with an Initiative patrol in Prismfall. Bonus: cheaper supplies and Iris can find arm parts.

**[B] Cut through the Tangle backcountry and take the mountain pass (slower but safer)**
> Longer route, more random encounters with wildlife. Avoids faction agents. Bonus: discover an abandoned waystation with lore and an Echo Fragment.

**[C] Head directly west through the Steppes (most dangerous, most direct)**
> Open terrain with no cover. Risk of Shepherd patrols. Fastest possible route. Bonus: encounter a Free Resonant caravan that provides supplies and information.

---

## Scene 3: The Waystation

**Location**: Abandoned waystation, halfway between Verdant Tangle and Ironcoast (this scene triggers on Route B; Routes A and C have alternate scenes — see notes)
**Party**: Kael, Lyra, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Late afternoon. Overcast. Smell of rain.
**Gameplay Context**: After 15-20 minutes of overworld exploration and random encounters.
**Estimated Duration**: 6 minutes

### Setting

A stone building with half its roof missing, built when the roads between regions were safer. The walls are solid, the floor is dry where the roof holds, and someone left a cache of supplies behind — recently, judging by the dust.

Faded Initiative markings on the wall. This was a supply point once. Abandoned in a hurry.

### Discovery

*The party enters carefully. Iris goes first, checking corners. Old habit.*

**IRIS**: Clear. *She pauses.* Supply crates. Some opened, some not. And—

*She holds up a soldering pick. Small, precise. Exactly what she needed.*

**IRIS**: Well. Someone was thinking of me.

**GARRICK**: Or someone was doing maintenance on Initiative equipment and left in a rush.

**IRIS**: Let me have this, Garrick.

*Kael pokes through the open crates. Ration packs, water purification tablets, a first aid kit. Basic survival gear.*

**KAEL**: This isn't old. This stuff was placed here... weeks ago? Maybe a month?

**LYRA**: A supply cache for agents. Standard Initiative protocol for extended operations. They must have had people moving through this corridor regularly.

**IRIS**: Until they didn't. Something pulled them back. Fast.

*Nyx finds something in the corner. A child's drawing, scratched into the stone wall with charcoal. A house with smoke coming out of the chimney. A family of stick figures.*

**NYX**: Someone small was here. And they drew what they wanted.

*Garrick looks at the drawing. His face does something complicated and then goes still.*

**GARRICK**: ...We should resupply and move on.

### The Echo

*As Kael moves through the waystation, their palms tingle. That familiar pull. An Echo, nearby.*

*They find it in the back room — a small crystal wedged into a crack in the wall, pulsing faintly blue.*

*Kael touches it.*

*[The world blurs. We see through the Echo's memory: An Initiative courier, young, maybe twenty. Sitting at a desk in this very room, writing a letter by lamplight. Their hands shake.]*

*ECHO VOICE (Initiative Courier):* "I know you said not to write. I know the censors read everything. But Mara — I saw what they're doing in Lab Seven. The people they bring in. They go in talking and come out... quiet. Not dead. Just empty. Like someone scooped them out and left the shell."

*[The memory flickers. The courier looks up, hearing something. Fear.]*

*ECHO VOICE:* "I'm requesting transfer. If that doesn't work, I'm leaving. I'd rather be a deserter than this. I just wanted to help rebuild things. I didn't sign up to—"

*[The Echo shatters. The room is stone and dust again.]*

**KAEL**: ...They were doing it even then. The Initiative. Hollowing people.

**IRIS**: Lab Seven is a designation I know. It's Sienna Vex's old project. *Her left hand — the prosthetic — tightens into a fist.* Resonance battery research. Turn people into living power cells.

**KAEL**: And Sienna's still in there. Still working for them.

**IRIS**: She's the Director's sister. Where else would she be?

### Gameplay Note

> Player receives Echo Fragment: "Courier's Doubt" (Story Echo). Waystation can be used as a rest point. Player can explore for additional items. When ready, continue west toward Gearhaven. Random encounters in the transition zone include: Creeping Vines (Verdant), Echo Nomads (Steppes transition), and a new enemy type — Ironcoast Border Drones (mechanical, weak to EMP).

---

## Scene 4: The Border

**Location**: The edge of Ironcoast Federation territory — a checkpoint on the trade road
**Party**: Kael, Lyra, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Dusk. Industrial smog visible on the western horizon. The air changes — tastes metallic.
**Gameplay Context**: Transition to Ironcoast region. First view of industrialized landscape.
**Estimated Duration**: 5 minutes

### Setting

The road widens. Paving stones replace dirt. There's a checkpoint ahead — a steel arch with Initiative flags, a guard booth, and a sensor array. But the booth is empty. The sensors are powered down. One of the flags has been torn and replaced with a white cloth — the Shepherds' symbol.

Someone fought here recently. Scorch marks on the pavement. A cracked helmet in the ditch.

### First Glimpse

*The party approaches cautiously.*

**IRIS**: This is checkpoint seven-seven. I've been through here a dozen times.

**KAEL**: It's empty.

**IRIS**: It shouldn't be. This checkpoint had a twelve-person rotation. Sensors, ID scanners, the works.

*Garrick kneels by the scorch marks. Runs a finger through the residue.*

**GARRICK**: Crystal fire. Purification charges. Shepherd-issue.

**IRIS**: Shepherds hit an Initiative checkpoint this deep into Federation territory?

**GARRICK**: Things are moving faster than we thought.

*Kael walks past the checkpoint. Beyond it, the landscape changes. The green of the Tangle fades. Factories line the horizon, their smokestacks drawing dark lines against the orange sky. Further west, the skyline of Gearhaven — massive, jagged, alien against everything they know.*

**KAEL**: I've never seen anything that big.

**LYRA**: Gearhaven. Fifty thousand people. The beating mechanical heart of the Ironcoast Federation. *Her voice goes distant.* It was a fishing village before the Severance. Just boats and nets and a market on Sundays.

**NYX**: *staring at the skyline* It's like someone built a forest out of metal and forgot to stop.

**IRIS**: Home sweet home.

*She doesn't sound happy about it.*

**GARRICK**: We'll need to be careful. Iris is a known deserter. Kael's face is probably on Initiative networks by now.

**IRIS**: I know a way in through the Harbor district. It'll cost us, but the smugglers there don't ask questions.

**KAEL**: Will they take Resonance credits?

**IRIS**: They'll take anything. That's what makes them smugglers.

### Choice: Entering Gearhaven

**[A] Go through the Harbor with Iris's contacts**
> Stealth entry. Costs 500 RC. Avoids detection. Sets up Chapter 12 harbor start.

**[B] Bluff your way through the main gate**
> Social challenge. Iris uses old Initiative codes. Risk of detection. If successful, access to High Rise district early.

## Camp Scene: What Nobody Asked

**Location**: Last camp before Gearhaven, rocky hillside overlooking the city lights
**Party**: Kael, Lyra, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Night. The city glows orange and blue below. Distant factory noise.
**Estimated Duration**: 5 minutes

### Setting

The city never goes dark. From up here, Gearhaven looks like a living thing — light pulsing through its streets, vehicles moving like blood cells through arteries. Smoke and steam rise from a hundred points. It's beautiful the way storms are beautiful.

Garrick made stew from rations and wild herbs. It's not good, but it's hot.

### Talk at the Fire

*Iris eats mechanically. She's been staring at the city.*

**GARRICK**: When's the last time you were home?

**IRIS**: Gearhaven isn't home. It's where I grew up. There's a difference.

**GARRICK**: Mmm.

**IRIS**: My brother's still down there somewhere. Dane. Still wearing the uniform. Still saluting people who'd sell him for parts if the quarterly numbers dipped.

*She digs her spoon into the stew harder than necessary.*

**IRIS**: He sent me a message after I deserted. One word. "Why."

**GARRICK**: Did you answer?

**IRIS**: What was I supposed to say? "Because your bosses are monsters and you're too loyal to see it"? "Because I couldn't look at myself in the mirror"? "Because I watched Subject Fourteen stop screaming on a Tuesday and it was the silence that broke me"?

*She puts the bowl down.*

**IRIS**: No. I didn't answer.

*Kael sits down next to her. Not too close.*

**KAEL**: We'll find a way to—

**IRIS**: Don't. Don't promise me things about my brother. I've been handling this since before you knew what an Anchor was.

*Kael pulls back. Stung.*

**IRIS**: ...Sorry. That was—

**KAEL**: True? Yeah.

**IRIS**: Unfair. It was unfair. You didn't ask for any of this.

**KAEL**: Neither did you.

*They sit with that for a while. Garrick adds a log to the fire.*

### Nyx and Lyra

*On the other side of camp, Nyx floats near Lyra, studying her translucent form.*

**NYX**: Lyra. Can I ask you something?

**LYRA**: Always, little one.

**NYX**: Are you scared?

**LYRA**: *pause* ...What makes you ask that?

**NYX**: You flicker more when you're scared. You've been flickering all day.

*Lyra looks down at her own hands. They're nearly see-through.*

**LYRA**: I suppose I am. Finding Kael's Anchor signature was... clarifying. But it also made my own fragmentation worse. The more I connect to the network, the more I risk losing the pieces I've gathered.

**NYX**: So getting better makes you worse?

**LYRA**: In a manner of speaking.

**NYX**: That seems poorly designed.

*Lyra laughs — a genuine, warm sound that makes her briefly more solid.*

**LYRA**: Yes. Yes, it does.

**NYX**: If you start to break apart again... I could hold your pieces. In my memory. Is that... would that be weird?

**LYRA**: *softly* No, Nyx. That wouldn't be weird. That would be very kind.

### Gameplay Note

> Camp scene ends. Bond points: Kael+Iris +1, Nyx+Lyra +1. Journal updates with Gearhaven approach objectives. When player is ready, proceed to Gearhaven entry. Chapter transition triggers at city gates.

## Scene 5: Ghost Protocol

**Location**: Gearhaven Harbor district, smuggler's dock
**Party**: Kael, Lyra (hidden — too conspicuous), Iris, Garrick, Nyx (disguised in cloak)
**Time**: Pre-dawn. Fog off the ocean. Smell of salt, oil, and fish.
**Gameplay Context**: Entry to Gearhaven. Iris leads. First experience of the industrial city.
**Estimated Duration**: 6 minutes

### Setting

The harbor is a maze of shipping containers, crane structures, and moored vessels. Everything is metal. The docks groan under weight. Workers in gray overalls move through the fog like ghosts. Crystal-powered lights cut through the murk in harsh cones.

Iris moves differently here — faster, lower, checking sightlines. She's in her element and hates it.

### The Smuggler

*The party follows Iris through a gap between containers. She knocks on a rusted door — three short, two long.*

*The door opens. A woman with a shaved head and a missing ear leans out. She smells like engine grease and cheap alcohol.*

**ZEN**: ...Iris Mantle. As I live and moderately prosper.

**IRIS**: Zen.

**ZEN**: You look terrible. Last I heard, Initiative had a bounty on you that'd buy a nice apartment in the High Rise.

**IRIS**: Last I heard, you were running arms for the Undercity militia.

**ZEN**: Diversified. *She looks past Iris at the group.* Friends of yours? Old guy looks like he could bench-press my boat.

**GARRICK**: She's not wrong.

**ZEN**: And the kid in the cloak with the... *She squints at Nyx, whose eyes glow faintly under the hood.* Okay. I don't want to know. Five hundred credits gets you past the harbor checkpoints. Another two hundred gets you a safehouse for the night. Non-negotiable.

**IRIS**: Three hundred total and I fix the port stabilizer on your boat. I can hear it whining from here.

*Zen narrows her eyes.*

**ZEN**: Four hundred. And you fix the stabilizer AND the radar array.

**IRIS**: Done.

*Zen steps aside. The party enters.*

### Inside

*The smuggler's den is cramped but functional. Maps on walls. Radio equipment. A cot that hasn't been made since the Severance.*

**ZEN**: So. Iris Mantle walks back into Gearhaven with a circus troupe. Must be something big.

**IRIS**: We're looking for someone. A hacker. Goes by—

**ZEN**: Don't tell me names. Names make me an accomplice. Just tell me what district and I'll point you at the right bars.

**IRIS**: Someone with... unusual abilities. Connected to the crystal network in ways that shouldn't be possible.

*Zen goes still. The casual smuggler act drops for just a moment.*

**ZEN**: There's been talk in the Undercity. Someone who's been hitting Initiative servers for months. Data theft, system disruptions, embarrassing leaks. Initiative's furious. They've got half the security division hunting for this person.

*She leans in.*

**ZEN**: Word is this hacker doesn't use any tools. No terminals, no equipment. Just... touches a server and it talks to them. Like magic, except the techheads are calling it something else.

**KAEL**: Resonance interfacing.

**ZEN**: Yeah. That's the term. *She looks at Kael more carefully.* You know what you're walking into?

**KAEL**: Roughly.

**ZEN**: Roughly isn't good enough in Gearhaven. Roughly gets you dead.

*She pulls a map off the wall and spreads it on the table.*

**ZEN**: The Undercity. Beneath the factory district. Used to be the old Gearhaven — the fishing village before the corporations built over it. It's where the people who don't want to be found go. If your hacker is anywhere, they're down there.

**IRIS**: Thank you, Zen.

**ZEN**: Don't thank me. Pay me. And Iris? *She touches her ear — the missing one.* Last time I helped someone the Initiative wanted, I lost this. Next time, they'll take something I need. So whatever you're doing... do it fast and do it somewhere else.

### Gameplay Note

> Player receives Gearhaven city map. Undercity marked as objective. Free exploration of Harbor district available — shops, NPCs, side quest hooks. Lyra rejoins party but warns she can't manifest in crowded areas without drawing attention. Nyx must keep their cloak on.

> NPC dialogue available in Harbor:
> - **Dock Worker**: "Another ship came in empty today. Third one this month. Captain says the crew just... stopped. Sat down. Wouldn't move. Hollow, all of 'em. It's getting worse."
> - **Fish Seller**: "Crystal clear, friend — prices are up because the catch is down. Something in the water's scaring the fish. My grandfather says the sea used to sing. Now it just hums. Like static."
> - **Initiative Poster**: [WANTED: Iris Mantle. Desertion, theft of classified materials, aiding enemies of the state. 10,000 RC reward.]
> - **Street Kid**: "Hey, you new? Word of advice — don't go below Level 3 without a light source. And I don't mean a torch. The dark down there *moves*."
> - **Retired Sailor**: "I sailed the Sea of Static once. Once. Came back with three fewer crew and a hold full of crystals that screamed when you touched 'em. Never again. Some things don't want to be found."

---

## Scene 6: The Weight of Names

**Location**: Safehouse in the Harbor district, a cramped room above a chandler's shop
**Party**: Kael, Lyra, Iris, Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Morning. Gray light through dirty windows. City noise below.
**Gameplay Context**: Planning scene before venturing into the Undercity.
**Estimated Duration**: 5 minutes

### Setting

The safehouse has two beds, a table, and a window that doesn't close all the way. The sounds of Gearhaven filter in — steam whistles, vehicle engines, shouting. It's never quiet here. Kael, who grew up with birdsong and rustling leaves, looks slightly haunted.

### Planning

*Iris has the map spread on the table. She's marked three locations in the Undercity.*

**IRIS**: Zen pointed us at three Undercity locations where our target might operate. This bar, this abandoned server farm, and this maintenance junction. We split up, we cover more ground, but—

**GARRICK**: We don't split up.

**IRIS**: I was going to say that.

**GARRICK**: Just making sure.

**IRIS**: We're being hunted by the two largest military forces on the continent. Splitting the party would be suicidal.

**KAEL**: Which one do we hit first?

**IRIS**: The bar. "The Broken Clock." Undercity watering hole. If this hacker is local, someone there will know something. We go in, we buy drinks, we listen.

**NYX**: I have never had a drink. What do they taste like?

**IRIS**: You're not having a drink. You're keeping your hood up and not talking.

**NYX**: But I have so many questions about Gearhaven.

**IRIS**: Save them. Seriously, Nyx — this isn't Roothollow. People here don't react well to things they can't explain, and you are extremely difficult to explain.

*Nyx's starfield eyes dim slightly.*

**KAEL**: Hey. She's not wrong about the danger, Nyx. But we're not ashamed of you. We just need to be careful.

**NYX**: ...Okay. I will be a careful shadow.

**LYRA**: I should stay behind as well. My form is too recognizable. Any Resonance-sensitive individual would register my presence immediately.

**KAEL**: Are you going to be okay alone?

**LYRA**: I've been alone for three hundred years, Kael. A few hours won't hurt.

*She says it lightly, but her form wavers.*

**KAEL**: We'll come back.

**LYRA**: I know you will. *Softer.* That's not something I've had reason to say in a very long time.

### Gameplay Note

> Party restructures: Kael, Iris, and Garrick enter the Undercity. Nyx stays with Lyra at the safehouse. Player can choose to explore the harbor further before descending. When ready, approach the Undercity entrance in the Factory District to trigger the descent.

> End of Chapter 11. Chapter 12 begins with the Undercity exploration and the search for Cipher.

## NPC Dialogue: Gearhaven Harbor (Optional Exploration)

**Harbor Guard (off-duty)**:
"Off the record? Morale's in the gutter. Command keeps reassigning people to 'Project Cage' — whatever that is. Nobody comes back from Project Cage assignments. Not dead, just... transferred somewhere classified. My partner got reassigned last month. Her desk is still the way she left it."

**Crystal Merchant**:
"Genuine Verdant Tangle Resonance crystals! Ethically sourced! ...Fine, 'ethically sourced' is overgrown. But they work. You want to power a lamp? Heat a room? These'll do it. Just don't — and I cannot stress this enough — don't try to tune your equipment with raw crystals. I've seen people lose fingers. And other, more important things."

**Undercity Elevator Operator**:
"Going down? Sure. But sign the waiver first. ...There's no waiver, I'm echoing with you. *laughs* But seriously, watch yourself. The Undercity's a different world. Different rules. Down there, Initiative badges don't mean crystal clear, and Shepherd prayers don't mean silence. Everyone's just trying to get by."

**Wanted Poster - Updated**:
[PRIORITY ALERT: Multiple persons of interest. Kael Voss — approach with extreme caution, do NOT engage alone. Resonance-sensitive. Iris Mantle — armed, cybernetic enhancement, former Special Operations. Garrick Thorne — former Shepherd, heavy armor class. Unknown minor — DO NOT approach. Unidentified Echo signature.

**Old Woman Feeding Pigeons**:
"You remind me of my granddaughter. She left for the Steppes last year. Said the air here tasted like pennies. She wasn't wrong. But it's home, you know? Even when it's terrible, it's still where your memories are. That's worth something. I think that's worth everything."

## End of Chapter 11

**Chapter Hook**: The party has entered Gearhaven — a city larger and more dangerous than anything they've faced. Somewhere in the Undercity, another Resonance Anchor hides from the same forces hunting them. But the Initiative's grip on this city is iron-tight, and the party's arrival hasn't gone unnoticed.

**Threads Advanced**:
- Kael's identity crisis (ongoing — they're holding it together, barely)
- Iris's brother Dane is somewhere in this city
- The Initiative's "Project Cage" referenced by NPCs
- Lyra's fragmentation worsening
- Nyx's discomfort with hiding who they are
- Shepherd aggression expanding (border checkpoint attack)

**Foreshadowing Planted**:
- Zen's missing ear (cost of opposing Initiative)
- The empty ships with Hollowed crews (Resonance instability increasing)
- "Project Cage" (the Resonance Cage Vex is building)
- Nyx's offer to hold Lyra's pieces (will matter in Act III)
