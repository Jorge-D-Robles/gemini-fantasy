# Cipher's Personal Quest: Ghost in the Machine

**Quest Type**: Character Personal Quest (Major)
**Availability**: Act II Chapter 14 through Act III Chapter 23
**Length**: 5-6 hours across Acts II-III
**Prerequisites**: Cipher in party (from Chapter 12), Cipher bond rank B+ or higher
**Emotional Arc**: Paranoia -> dread -> violation -> rupture -> reclamation (or compromise)

**Summary**: Cipher has spent sixteen years running from the Initiative, building walls -- digital, physical, emotional -- to keep the world at arm's length. They've turned paranoia into survival instinct and isolation into armor. But the Initiative has been building something worse than a cage: a leash. The Anchor Control Protocol is a device that can remotely hijack a Resonance Anchor's consciousness, turning their body into a puppet. Cipher discovers it exists. Cipher sees it used on someone else. And then Cipher feels it used on them. The quest is about the thing Cipher fears most -- not death, not capture, but being in their own body while someone else drives. Being reduced to a passenger in their own skull. Breaking free requires something Cipher has spent their whole life avoiding: asking for help. Trusting that the people standing next to them won't just watch.

**Connection to Main Story**: The Anchor Control Protocol is a Resonance Cage subsystem -- Vex developed it as a failsafe to ensure Anchors cooperate during the Cage's activation sequence. Destroying or reprogramming the device in Scene 5 directly affects Act III's Resonance Cage confrontation. If destroyed, Vex cannot force Anchors to power the Cage. If reprogrammed, the party gains a tactical advantage. If used on Vex, the moral calculus of the party's crusade shifts.

## Scene 1: Breadcrumbs

**Location**: Gearhaven Undercity, Cipher's new safehouse (a gutted relay station on Level 3)
**Party**: Kael, Cipher, Iris
**Time**: Late evening. Rain above ground -- they can hear it through the drainage grates. Water drips from exposed pipes.
**Gameplay Context**: Triggered during Act II (Chapter 14-16 window). Cipher has been running network sweeps from the safehouse. After returning from a story dungeon, a camp conversation with Cipher triggers this scene.
**Estimated Duration**: 8 minutes

### Setting

Cipher's safehouse looks like the inside of a skull that thinks too much. Cables run from wall to wall in color-coded bundles. Three salvaged monitors cycle through Initiative communications feeds. A cot in the corner hasn't been slept in -- the blanket is folded exactly how it was two days ago. On the workbench: a half-disassembled Resonance dampener, two empty caffeine ampoules, and a sandwich someone made for Cipher that they haven't touched. The sandwich is from Garrick. It's been there since yesterday.

### The Pull

*Cipher sits cross-legged on the floor, visor down, both palms pressed to a junction box they've wired into the Undercity's backbone. Their tattoos pulse in a slow, irregular rhythm. Data scrolls across the monitors -- personnel transfers, supply manifests, encrypted chatter.*

*Kael enters with Iris. They've been standing there for thirty seconds before Cipher speaks.*

**CIPHER**: Seven.

**KAEL**: Seven what?

**CIPHER**: Seconds since you walked in. Iris breathes louder than she thinks. Prosthetic servo hums at 400 hertz -- you really should get that looked at.

**IRIS**: And you really should eat something. Garrick's sandwich is developing its own personality.

*Cipher pulls off the visor. Their eyes are bloodshot. The tattoos are still pulsing even disconnected.*

**CIPHER**: I found something. In the Initiative's network. Something I wasn't supposed to find, which is how I know it's real -- the things they actually hide are never where you'd look.

*They stand. Pull up a monitor. Financial records.*

**CIPHER**: So. The Initiative's been diverting funds from six different departments into a project with no name. No official project number. No oversight committee. The budget comes from a line item labeled "equipment maintenance." Twelve million credits over three years funneled through equipment maintenance. Nobody fixes that many printers.

**IRIS**: Where's it going?

**CIPHER**: A facility on the coast. North of Gearhaven, near the old naval yards. The building doesn't exist on any map I can find. The power consumption is massive -- I'm talking reactor-level draw for a building that supposedly isn't there. And here's the thing that's got my stomach doing backflips.

*They pull up a personnel file. Redacted. Heavily redacted. But the department header is visible: ANCHOR RESEARCH DIVISION.*

**CIPHER**: There's a division. A whole division. Dedicated to studying Anchors. Us. Me and Kael and Lyra. They've been running experiments for at least two years. And the project they're funding? It's called the Anchor Control Protocol.

*Silence. Cipher's hands are moving faster now -- pulling up more data, cross-referencing, the visor flickering between displays.*

**CIPHER**: Control. Not study. Not understand. Control. Two cameras on the north approach, one drone patrol, rotating shifts -- I've already mapped the security. I need to get inside that facility.

**KAEL**: Cipher, slow down. You just said this is a trap-level discovery. Hidden data, no name, a building that doesn't exist. What if they wanted you to find this?

*Cipher stops. Their jaw works.*

**CIPHER**: ...Yeah. That crossed my mind. About forty times in the last hour. But that's the problem with paranoia, right? At some point you can't tell the difference between a real threat and the sound of your own brain screaming. And I can't afford to be wrong about this one.

*They pick up Garrick's sandwich. Look at it. Put it back down.*

**CIPHER**: If they can control an Anchor -- control their body, their abilities, make them do whatever the operator wants -- then running doesn't matter. Hiding doesn't matter. Sixteen years of keeping myself free and they can just... reach in and take the wheel.

**IRIS**: You don't know that's what it does.

**CIPHER**: The project is literally called the Anchor Control Protocol. I'm not exactly reading between the lines here.

**IRIS**: Fair point.

*Cipher turns to Kael. Their voice is quieter now. Faster, but quieter.*

**CIPHER**: I need to see what's in that facility. I need to know what they've built and how close it is to working. And I need people watching my back when I go in, because going alone is -- *(they stop)* -- going alone is how I've always done it. And right now I'm thinking maybe that's not enough.

*They look away. This admission cost them something.*

**KAEL**: We'll go with you. All of us.

**CIPHER**: Not all of you. Small team. Three, maybe four. In and out, no firefights. Iris, because she knows Initiative security protocols. You, because you're the other Anchor and if that device exists, you should know about it. And... maybe Sienna. She might recognize the tech.

**KAEL**: When?

**CIPHER**: Tomorrow night. New moon. Minimal visibility. And Kael? If I'm right about this -- if they've really built a way to hijack an Anchor's body -- I need you to promise me something.

**KAEL**: Name it.

**CIPHER**: If they use it on me. If they turn me into... into a thing that fights you. Don't hold back. Don't try to talk me down. Don't be a hero. Just put me on the ground as fast as you can. Crystal clear?

*Kael doesn't answer immediately.*

**CIPHER**: Kael.

**KAEL**: Crystal clear.

### Gameplay Note

> Quest log updated: "Ghost in the Machine -- Stage 1." New objective: Infiltrate the unmarked Initiative facility north of Gearhaven. Party is locked to Kael, Cipher, Iris, and optionally Sienna for the next quest stage. If Sienna is not yet recruited, Cipher brings a device that serves a similar analytical function. A camp conversation unlocks where Garrick asks Cipher about the untouched sandwich, leading to a brief, awkward moment where Cipher admits they don't know how to accept kindness without scanning it for threats first.

## Scene 2: The Kennel

**Location**: Unmarked Initiative research facility, coastal bluffs north of Gearhaven
**Party**: Kael, Cipher, Iris, Sienna (optional fourth)
**Time**: Past midnight. No moon. Wind off the sea. Salt spray.
**Gameplay Context**: Stealth infiltration dungeon. Cipher's hacking abilities are central. Environmental puzzles involve disabling security grids, spoofing keycard readers, and navigating a facility designed to contain Resonance-sensitive prisoners.
**Estimated Duration**: 20 minutes (stealth gameplay + 12 minutes story)

### Setting

The facility is a concrete bunker dug into the cliff face. From outside, it looks like a decommissioned water treatment plant -- rusted pipes, faded warning signs, a chain-link fence with gaps big enough for a dog. The deception is skin-deep. Behind the first door, the concrete gives way to polished steel and surgical lighting. The halls are white and humming. It smells like ozone and antiseptic. Like a hospital that doesn't want you to leave.

### Approach

*The party crouches behind a rusted pump housing. Cipher's visor is down, tattoos pulsing as they scan.*

**CIPHER**: Two guards at the main entrance. Rotating every forty minutes. Electronic lock, biometric -- fingerprint and retinal. Four cameras on the east wall, blind spot at the drainage culvert. One Resonance dampener field covering the front approach -- forty-meter radius.

*They tap the visor.*

**CIPHER**: The dampener is the problem. We walk through that field and my abilities go dead. Iris, your prosthetic will lose half its motor function. It's designed to neutralize people like us.

**IRIS**: Can you kill it remotely?

**CIPHER**: If I could kill it remotely, I wouldn't be lying in wet gravel right now. It's on an isolated circuit. Has to be disabled from inside. But the drainage culvert bypasses the field -- it's underground, below the dampener's effective radius. We go in through the pipes.

**KAEL**: Through the pipes. Great.

**CIPHER**: What, you wanted a red carpet?

*If Sienna is present:*

**SIENNA**: The dampener design is -- *she adjusts her glasses* -- it's my design. I developed the field generator for medical quarantine applications. To prevent Resonance-corrupted patients from affecting hospital staff. I never intended it for-- *(pause)* --this is going to keep happening, isn't it. Every door we open is going to have my fingerprints on it.

**IRIS**: Join the club. We've got jackets.

### Gameplay Note

> Stealth dungeon begins. Three sections: drainage tunnels (environmental hazards -- flooded passages, unstable grating), maintenance level (security patrols, hackable terminals), and research wing (Resonance dampener zones, locked cells). Cipher can hack doors, disable cameras, and spoof guard communications. Iris can force locks and disable mechanical traps. Sienna can identify and safely handle Resonance containment equipment. Getting detected raises alert level -- at maximum alert, the facility locks down and a combat gauntlet triggers. Stealth completion grants bonus loot and a hidden Echo.

---

### Deep Inside

*The party reaches the research wing. The hallway is lined with reinforced glass cells. Most are empty. Some aren't.*

*Cell 4: a woman sits on a metal cot, staring at nothing. She's wearing a hospital gown. There's a port at the base of her skull -- surgical, recent. Her eyes are open but nobody's home.*

*Cell 7: a man paces. His hands shake. The port at his skull base is older, scarred around the edges. He mouths words but no sound comes out.*

*Cell 11: empty. But the walls are covered in scratches. Hundreds of them. Tallied in groups of five.*

*Cipher stops at Cell 4. Presses their hand to the glass. Their tattoos pulse -- once.*

**CIPHER**: She's an Anchor. Low-grade. Not like me or Kael. But she's got the markers. They've got a port installed at her brain stem. Some kind of receiver.

*Iris checks the cell's data panel.*

**IRIS**: Subject 4-A. Inducted fourteen months ago. Listed as "voluntary participant." Current status: "responsive to Protocol input."

**CIPHER**: Responsive to--

*They don't finish. They're staring at the woman's face. She hasn't blinked.*

**KAEL**: Cipher?

**CIPHER**: She's breathing. She's alive. But she's not... there's nobody behind the eyes. Her body is running but the person is--

*They step back from the glass.*

**CIPHER**: *(fast, clipped)* There's a control room. End of the hall. Terminal access. I need to see the project data. I need to see what they did to her.

### The Control Room

*A wide room with banks of monitors. On-screen: brain wave patterns, Resonance frequency charts, a 3D model of the brain stem port. And video logs.*

*Cipher's hands move across the terminal. Files cascade open. Their face goes tight.*

**CIPHER**: The Anchor Control Protocol. Here it is. All of it.

*They pull up a technical schematic. A device the size of a deck of cards -- sleek, Initiative-branded, with a small antenna array and a crystal interface.*

**CIPHER**: It's a transmitter. Paired to the receiver port in the subject's brain stem. The operator inputs commands from a remote terminal. Motor functions, speech, even-- *(they scroll)* --even emotional state. They can make you smile. They can make you cry. They can make you pull the trigger on your best friend and then make you feel good about it.

*If Sienna is present:*

**SIENNA**: The frequency modulation is-- *(she leans closer, hands shaking)* --it's using Resonance harmonics to override autonomic nervous function. The Anchor's consciousness is still present. They feel everything. They just can't... they can't stop any of it. They're locked in.

*Cipher is very still. Their tattoos have stopped pulsing entirely.*

**CIPHER**: Locked in. Awake in there. Watching your hands do things you didn't tell them to do.

**KAEL**: Cipher, we can--

**CIPHER**: Play the video log.

*Kael hesitates.*

**CIPHER**: Play it.

*Kael plays it.*

### The Demonstration

*On-screen: the woman from Cell 4 stands in a white room. Two Initiative technicians sit at a control station behind reinforced glass. A voice -- male, bored, clinical -- speaks over the intercom.*

**TECHNICIAN (VIDEO)**: Subject 4-A, Protocol test seventeen. Stand up.

*The woman stands. Mechanical. Smooth.*

**TECHNICIAN (VIDEO)**: Walk to the east wall. Touch it. Walk back.

*She does. Perfectly. Like a marionette with good strings.*

**TECHNICIAN (VIDEO)**: Now. Emotional override. Set baseline to... let's do joy. Seventy percent.

*The woman's face changes. Not naturally -- too fast, too complete. She smiles. A wide, bright smile that reaches her eyes. Genuine. Indistinguishable from real happiness.*

*But her hand is at her side, fingers curled, nails digging into her palm. Drawing blood. The only part of her body she can still control.*

**TECHNICIAN (VIDEO)**: Good. Clean signal. Note for Director Vex -- the Protocol is stable at sustained override durations exceeding four hours. Recommend moving to Phase Three: paired Anchor trials. If we can control two Anchors simultaneously, the Cage deployment becomes--

*Cipher kills the video. The screen goes black.*

*Nobody speaks.*

*Cipher's hands are flat on the console. Their breathing is audible. Fast. Getting faster.*

**CIPHER**: Four hours. She sat in there for four hours, smiling, while they-- while she was--

*They push back from the console. Walk to the wall. Stand with their forehead against it.*

**CIPHER**: *(barely audible)* I need a minute.

*Iris looks at Kael. Kael shakes their head: give them space.*

*Thirty seconds pass.*

*Cipher turns around. Their face is blank. Professional. The mask is back on, but it doesn't fit right anymore.*

**CIPHER**: I'm downloading everything. All of it. The schematics, the trial data, the personnel files. Then we get out. And then we figure out how to--

*An alarm. Red lights. The facility shakes.*

*On the monitors, cameras show Initiative soldiers pouring through the main entrance. Twelve. Fifteen. Twenty. Resonance dampeners active. And at the front of the column, a man in a gray suit walking with the calm of someone who expected this.*

*The screens resolve his face: Director Vex Thornwright.*

**CIPHER**: He knew. He knew I'd come here. The financial trail, the unlocked data -- it was a lure. And I walked right into it. Four cameras, twenty guards, two exits, both compromised, dampener field active--

*Their voice is accelerating. Sentences fragmenting.*

**CIPHER**: --one ventilation shaft, too small. Drainage pipes, they'll have sealed them. Service elevator-- no, they'd have the codes. I could overload the power grid but that kills the dampener AND my interface and then--

**IRIS**: Cipher. Focus. What's our exit?

*Cipher stops. Breathes. Looks at the schematic on-screen.*

**CIPHER**: The dampener is on a separate power circuit. If I can get to the generator room on sublevel two and cut the dampener's power supply, I get my abilities back. With my abilities, I can crash their communications, blind their cameras, and open the sea-cliff emergency exit. Without the dampener, we fight our way out. With it... we're just four people in a concrete box.

**KAEL**: Then we get to sublevel two.

**CIPHER**: Two floors down. Through their perimeter. Through Vex's kill team.

**KAEL**: We've done worse.

**CIPHER**: When?

**KAEL**: ...I'm sure it'll come to me.

### Gameplay Note

> Combat gauntlet: fight through Initiative soldiers while navigating to the sublevel generator. Cipher is debuffed (Resonance dampener effect reduces all stats by 30%) until the dampener is disabled. Environmental puzzle: reroute power to shut down the dampener. Once disabled, Cipher regains full abilities and can hack the emergency exit open. Boss fight: Initiative Captain Renata Voss (no relation to Kael -- the name is a deliberate taunt by Vex) -- a Resonance-enhanced soldier with anti-Anchor weaponry. Defeating her opens the path to the sea-cliff exit.

> During the escape, the party passes Cell 4. Optional interaction: free the test subjects (delays escape, increases difficulty of final combat encounter, but grants a unique Echo: "Subject 4-A's Gratitude" -- support type, removes all control/charm effects from party).

## Scene 3: Hijacked

**Location**: Camp, Crystalline Steppes (or current story location)
**Party**: Full party
**Time**: Three days after Scene 2. Evening. Fire crackling.
**Gameplay Context**: Triggered automatically after two story events or dungeon completions following Scene 2. Cannot be avoided.
**Estimated Duration**: 15 minutes (story + boss fight)

### Setting

Camp. The kind of evening that should feel safe. Garrick made stew. Nyx is watching a beetle cross a rock with the focus of a scholar examining an ancient text. Ash sits near the fire, and the warmth radiating from them is more than physical -- something loose and comfortable. Iris is cleaning her prosthetic's servo joint. Cipher is at the edge of camp, visor down, running their nightly security sweep.

Everything is fine.

### The Sweep

**CIPHER**: Perimeter clear. No Initiative signatures within two kilometers. Three wildlife contacts -- probably foxes. One Resonance anomaly to the north, but it's a natural crystal deposit, not a device. We're good.

*They pull the visor up. Look at the camp. Something crosses their face -- not quite a smile, but the shape of one.*

*Kael notices.*

**KAEL**: You're staring.

**CIPHER**: I'm doing threat assessment.

**KAEL**: You're staring at the fire. And the stew. And Nyx talking to a beetle.

**CIPHER**: I'm assessing the threat level of the beetle. It could be an Initiative spy. You don't know.

**KAEL**: Cipher.

**CIPHER**: ...It's a nice camp. That's all. I've slept in a lot of bad places. Server rooms. Drainage pipes. One time, a deactivated garbage compactor. This is-- *(they gesture at the fire, the party, the sky)* --this is something I forgot existed.

*A warmth bloomed in Kael's chest that wasn't from the fire. Ash was looking at Cipher, eyes cycling through soft golds and ambers.*

**KAEL**: You could get used to it.

**CIPHER**: Don't say that. Getting used to things is how you--

*They stop. Mid-sentence. Their tattoos flare -- not the usual slow pulse, but a sharp, staccato burst. White-hot.*

*Cipher's hands drop to their sides.*

### The Override

*Something is wrong with Cipher's face. Their expression hasn't changed -- that's the problem. It's frozen. The sarcastic half-grin they were wearing a second ago is still there, but the eyes behind it have gone flat. Like a light switching off behind a window.*

**KAEL**: Cipher?

*Cipher doesn't respond. Their head turns. Precise. Mechanical. A forty-five-degree rotation, as if on a swivel. They look at Kael. Through Kael.*

*Their mouth opens.*

**CIPHER**: *(wrong voice -- still their vocal cords, but the cadence is different, the rhythm is wrong, too measured, too calm)* Good evening. I apologize for the interruption.

*Iris is on her feet. Weapon drawn.*

**KAEL**: That's not Cipher.

**CIPHER/VEX**: Not entirely, no. Director Vex Thornwright, speaking through your friend. Don't worry -- they can hear everything. They just can't do anything about it. Not yet.

*Cipher's body stands. Fluid. Controlled. Their hands hang loose at their sides.*

**CIPHER/VEX**: I wanted to demonstrate. You found my facility. You saw the test subjects. I'm sure you were horrified. But you didn't fully appreciate the scope of what we've achieved. So I thought a practical demonstration was in order.

**GARRICK**: How.

**CIPHER/VEX**: The Anchor Control Protocol doesn't require a surgical port. That was the first-generation approach -- crude, invasive, effective but limited. The current version uses the Resonance network itself. Every crystal in a fifty-kilometer radius acts as a relay antenna. The signal is ambient. Invisible. And Cipher has been absorbing it for three days. Since before your charming campfire.

*Nyx is standing. Their starfield eyes are cycling fast -- fear, confusion, anger. The beetle on the rock has stopped moving too.*

**NYX**: *(mind-voice, directed at Cipher)* You're in there. I can feel you in there. You're screaming.

**CIPHER/VEX**: They are. Metaphorically. The human mind is remarkably resilient -- Cipher's especially. They're fighting the override with everything they have. It's actually quite impressive. Won't change anything, but impressive.

*Cipher's body draws their dual blades. The movement is wrong -- too smooth, too theatrical. Cipher fights like a brawler. This is choreography.*

**CIPHER/VEX**: Now. I'm going to have your friend attack you. Not to kill -- I need Cipher alive, and I need you alive, and frankly the logistics of remote-piloting someone through lethal combat are still being refined. But I need you to understand what happens if you continue interfering with the Cage project. This is not a threat. This is a proof of concept.

*Cipher lunges at Kael.*

### The Dual Battle

*[GAMEPLAY: Boss fight with unique mechanics. The party fights Cipher's body, which is controlled by Vex's Protocol. Cipher has enhanced stats (Protocol amplification) but uses unfamiliar attack patterns -- Vex is a competent operator but doesn't know Cipher's fighting style. The party must reduce Cipher's HP to 30% without using lethal-damage abilities.*

*Simultaneously: split-screen or phase shifts show Cipher's internal battle. Between combat rounds, brief interactive sequences play inside Cipher's consciousness -- Cipher fighting through static and interference to regain motor control. The player makes choices as Cipher: which memories to hold onto, which fears to push through.*

*Key mechanic: if the party uses "lethal" abilities (marked with skull icon), Cipher takes permanent stat damage. If they use "restraint" abilities (marked with blue icon -- all party members gain these temporarily), Cipher recovers fully after the fight.]*

### Mid-Battle: Inside

*[Interior sequence. Cipher's consciousness is represented as a fragmented version of their safehouse. The monitors show their own body attacking their friends, from the inside. The cables on the walls are pulled taut -- something is trying to rip the room apart.]*

*Cipher stands in the center of the room. Their hands are on the junction box -- trying to interface, trying to find the signal and kill it.*

**CIPHER**: *(to themselves)* Come on come on come on. It's a signal. It's just a signal. Every signal has a source and every source has an off switch. Find the frequency, isolate it, cut it--

*The monitors flicker. Cipher's body hits Kael. The impact translates -- Cipher feels it, from the wrong side.*

**CIPHER**: No no no no--

*Static. The room distorts. For a moment, it's not the safehouse -- it's a white room. A chair with restraints. A port at the back of a neck. Subject 4-A's room.*

*Cipher's worst fear. Their body doing things they didn't choose. And being awake for all of it.*

**CIPHER**: *(fast, desperate, counting)* Three friends in camp. One Kael. One Iris. One Garrick. One Nyx. One Ash. One Sienna. One Lyra. Seven. Seven people I didn't let in and now they're watching me try to kill them and I can't-- I can't--

*A sound. Not from the room. From outside. From the camp. Muffled, but real.*

*Garrick's voice, transmitted through the Resonance link between Cipher and the world:*

**GARRICK**: *(distant, strained)* ...We're not going to hurt you, Cipher. We know you're in there. Keep fighting.

*The room stabilizes. Just slightly. Enough.*

**CIPHER**: ...Keep fighting. Yeah. That I can do.

### Breaking Through

*[The party reduces Cipher's body to 30% HP. Cipher, from the inside, has been weakening the control signal through the interior sequences. The two efforts converge.]*

*Cipher's body staggers. The blades drop. Their hands go to their head.*

*When they speak, two voices overlap -- Vex's measured calm and Cipher's ragged fury.*

**CIPHER/VEX**: Fascinating resilience--

**CIPHER**: Get-- out-- of my-- HEAD--

*Their tattoos blaze. Not the Protocol's staccato white -- their own blue-green, surging from their core outward. The Resonance frequency shifts. Cipher isn't just fighting the signal anymore; they're overwriting it.*

*The split-screen collapses. One Cipher. One voice.*

**CIPHER**: SEVEN PEOPLE. SEVEN EXITS. AND YOU'RE NOT IN ANY OF THEM.

*A pulse of Resonance blows outward from Cipher. Every crystal in a thirty-meter radius cracks. The fire flares. The control signal dies.*

*Cipher drops to their knees. Breathing hard. Their own breathing. Their own hands on the ground. Their own tears on the dirt.*

*Nobody moves.*

*Then Iris does. She walks to Cipher. Kneels. Puts her hand -- the prosthetic one, the metal one, the one that buzzes at 400 hertz -- on their shoulder.*

**IRIS**: You're back.

*Cipher's hand comes up. Covers Iris's metal fingers. Grips.*

**CIPHER**: *(barely a whisper)* ...I could feel it. All of it. My hands hitting Kael. My legs moving. And I couldn't-- *(their voice cracks)* --I couldn't stop any of it. I was right there and I couldn't stop any of it.

*A warmth pressed against Cipher's other side. Ash, sitting close, their eyes cycling through deep blues -- sadness, not their own, but held gently, like something they wanted to carry for someone who needed to put it down.*

*Cipher doesn't pull away.*

### Gameplay Note

> Quest log updated: "Ghost in the Machine -- Stage 3." Cipher gains temporary debuff: "Fractured Trust" (reduced stats for two story events -- represents trauma, not mechanical punishment). However, Cipher also gains the passive ability "Signal Awareness" -- can detect Resonance control frequencies, granting the party immunity to surprise Protocol attacks going forward.

> Camp scene unlocks: Cipher sits apart from the group. Each party member can approach. Kael's conversation: Cipher admits the seven-people count wasn't a combat tally -- it was the number of people they'd miss. Iris's conversation: they sit in silence for a long time, then Iris says "When I lost my arm, the phantom pain was the worst part. You could still feel the thing they took." Cipher says "Yeah." Garrick brings a new sandwich. Cipher eats it.

---

## Scene 4: The Room Inside the Room

**Location**: Cipher's consciousness -- a fractured digital landscape
**Party**: Kael (controlling), Cipher (guide/NPC), with echoes of other party members
**Time**: Subjective. Could be seconds. Could be hours.
**Gameplay Context**: Triggered in Act II-III transition (Chapter 19-20 window). Cipher has been withdrawn since Scene 3. Sienna's diagnostic reveals residual Protocol code embedded in Cipher's Resonance signature -- a backdoor that could be reactivated at any time. The only way to remove it is from the inside: someone has to enter Cipher's consciousness through a voluntary Resonance link and help Cipher find and destroy the embedded code.
**Estimated Duration**: 25 minutes (dungeon + story)

### Setting

The inside of Cipher's mind. It looks like Gearhaven -- but wrong. Buildings are stacked at impossible angles. Streets loop back on themselves. The sky is a ceiling of scrolling code. Everything is rendered in blues and greens -- the color of Cipher's tattoo glow -- except for patches of white static that crackle and spread like frost on glass. Those are the Protocol's remnants. Its fingerprints on Cipher's consciousness.

The city is populated. Not with people -- with memories. Cipher's memories, walking around like NPCs in a game they didn't ask to be in.

### Entry

*[Kael enters the mindscape through a Resonance link, guided by Sienna's equipment and Lyra's expertise. The transition is a screen-dissolve: the camp fades and the city writes itself into existence, one building at a time, like loading a save file.]*

*Cipher is waiting at the entry point -- a version of the Broken Clock bar, floating upside-down above the street.*

**CIPHER**: Welcome to my head. Mind the architecture. I was going for "organized chaos" but I think it landed closer to "anxiety attack rendered in three dimensions."

**KAEL**: This is how you see yourself? A city?

**CIPHER**: I'm a systems person. I think in networks. Everything's connected, everything has a path, and right now about fifteen percent of my paths have been rerouted through Initiative code I can't remove by myself. So. Thanks for coming.

*They start walking. The streets shift under their feet -- not dangerously, just constantly. Cipher navigates by instinct.*

**CIPHER**: The Protocol left three nodes in my head. Three chunks of code that are buried deep enough that I can't get to them alone. My defenses keep sliding off them -- it's like trying to grab a fish with oiled hands. I need someone who isn't me to hold them still while I pull them out.

**KAEL**: Why can't you reach them yourself?

**CIPHER**: Because they're in the parts of me I don't look at. The locked rooms. The memories I filed under "never open." The Protocol was smart -- it anchored itself to the things I'm most afraid of. So to kill it, I have to go to the places I've been running from my whole life.

*They stop at a crossroads. Three streets branch off. Each one is different.*

**CIPHER**: Three nodes. Three locked rooms. Your call on the order.

### Node One: The Apartment

*[The first street leads to a residential block. A specific apartment. The door is number 1247.]*

*Inside: a cramped studio apartment. A sixteen-year-old sits at a desk covered in dismantled crystal components. They look like Cipher -- thinner, younger, no tattoos yet, hair grown out in messy curls. They're pressing their hand to a crystal terminal. The terminal is talking back.*

*This is the memory of the day Cipher discovered they were an Anchor.*

**CIPHER**: *(to Kael, quiet)* I was sixteen. I touched a terminal at school and the entire network opened up. Not like hacking -- like breathing. I could feel every node, every connection, every piece of data flowing through the crystals. It was the most natural thing I'd ever done.

*The memory plays. The sixteen-year-old Cipher pulls their hand away. Looks at it. Their fingers have started to glow.*

*Then the door of the apartment smashes open. Initiative soldiers. Four of them. A woman in a lab coat with a scanner.*

**SCIENTIST (MEMORY)**: Resonance signature confirmed. Mark this one as Priority Alpha. Induction team, move in.

*Young Cipher bolts. Out the window. Down the fire escape. Into the Undercity for the first time. Running.*

*The white static is here -- threaded through the memory like veins in marble. The Protocol has attached itself to this moment: the first time Cipher ran. The first time they understood that their body wasn't entirely theirs.*

**CIPHER**: The Protocol grafted onto this memory because it's where the fear started. The fear that someone else has a claim on my body. That being an Anchor means I'm... public property.

**KAEL**: You're not property.

**CIPHER**: Tell that to the woman in Cell 4.

*[Gameplay: navigate the memory. Find the Protocol node -- represented as a white crystal embedded in the wall of the apartment. Kael must hold it stable (button-mashing or rhythm minigame) while Cipher hacks it. Enemies: Memory Fragments that attack when the Protocol is disturbed -- they look like Initiative soldiers but glitch and stutter.]*

*The node shatters. The memory replays -- but differently this time. Young Cipher still runs. But at the bottom of the fire escape, there's someone waiting. Not to capture them. Just... standing there. Offering a hand.*

*The person looks like a composite of the party. Features from everyone -- Kael's eyes, Iris's stance, Garrick's hands.*

**CIPHER**: *(staring)* ...That wasn't in the original memory.

**KAEL**: Maybe it's a new one.

### Node Two: The Bridge

*[The second street leads to Gearhaven's harbor bridge. Night. Rain. Cipher -- older now, early twenties -- stands at the railing. They're alone. They've been alone for six years.]*

*This is the memory of the night Cipher almost stopped running.*

**CIPHER**: *(to Kael, not looking at them)* I was twenty-two. I'd been living in the Undercity for six years. No friends. No name anyone knew. Just handles and aliases and safe houses. I hadn't touched another person in... *(they count)* ...eleven months. Not a handshake. Not a shoulder brush on the street. Nothing.

*The memory-Cipher stands at the railing. Looking down at the water. Not climbing. Just standing very close to the edge.*

**CIPHER**: I wasn't going to jump. I want that on the record. I was just... tired. Tired of being a thing that runs. Tired of being a body that the Initiative has a warrant for. I stood there for two hours and I thought: what if I just stopped? Not stopped living. Stopped running. Went to them. Surrendered. Let them do whatever they wanted with the Anchor thing in my head. At least then someone would know my name.

*The white static is thick here. The Protocol has sunk deep into this memory -- into the loneliness, the exhaustion, the part of Cipher that once considered giving up.*

**CIPHER**: The Protocol grabbed this because it's the crack in the wall. The moment I was weakest. If you can convince someone they've already surrendered once, the second time is easier.

*[Gameplay: the Protocol node is at the center of the bridge. Getting to it requires navigating through a storm of memory fragments -- moments of isolation, empty rooms, unanswered messages, meals eaten alone. These aren't enemies to fight; they're obstacles to push through. The player walks Kael forward against increasing resistance -- a physical metaphor for what Cipher does every day.]*

*The node shatters. The memory shifts.*

*Twenty-two-year-old Cipher turns from the railing. Walks away from the bridge. And this time, the Undercity isn't empty. Lights are on in the windows. Someone waves from a doorway. Ratchet, younger, with two good eyes, holding up a wrench and a bottle of something.*

**CIPHER**: *(voice rough)* Ratchet found me the next morning. In a doorway, asleep. She didn't ask questions. Just gave me a blanket and something to eat and told me the power grid on Level Five needed fixing. Gave me something to do with my hands.

*They pause.*

**CIPHER**: I never told anyone about the bridge. Not Ratchet. Not anyone. Now you know.

**KAEL**: Thank you for telling me.

**CIPHER**: Don't make it a thing.

**KAEL**: I won't.

**CIPHER**: ...Thanks.

### Node Three: The Mirror

*[The third street leads to a bathroom. A mirror. Present-day Cipher stands in front of it. But the reflection isn't them.*

*The reflection is Cipher during Scene 3 -- under Protocol control. Same face, same body, but the eyes are wrong. Flat. Operated. The mouth is smiling because someone told it to.*

*This is the memory of what happened three days ago. It's the freshest wound.]*

**CIPHER**: I knew this one would be the worst.

*The reflection moves. Cipher doesn't. It draws its blades. Cipher's blades.*

**CIPHER**: This is the one I can't look at. The thing I actually am afraid of. Not the Initiative. Not running. Not being alone. This. Being inside my body while someone else uses it. Knowing that everything I've built -- every wall, every defense, every sixteen years of staying free -- can be undone by a signal I can't see.

*The reflection speaks. Vex's cadence. Cipher's throat.*

**REFLECTION**: You were never free. You were just far enough away from the leash that you forgot it was there.

**CIPHER**: *(to Kael)* I need you to fight it. My reflection. I can't do it myself -- it IS myself. If I attack it, the Protocol loops. I need someone from outside to hold it down while I pull the code out of its chest.

*[Gameplay: boss fight against Protocol Cipher -- a mirror version of Cipher with Vex's attack patterns. Kael fights alone (with echoes of party members providing support abilities). Protocol Cipher uses Cipher's hacking abilities against Kael -- jamming abilities, disrupting the UI, inverting controls for brief periods. It's disorienting by design. When Protocol Cipher reaches 40% HP, the UI stabilizes and Cipher enters the fight alongside Kael for the final push.]*

*The reflection shatters. Behind it: not a wall. An open window. Wind. Light. The sound of people.*

*The Protocol code dissolves. The static is gone. The city in Cipher's mind is still strange, still stacked sideways and looping, but the white frost is gone from its surfaces.*

*Cipher stands at the window. Looks out.*

**CIPHER**: It's clean. My head is-- *(they stop, almost laugh)* --my head is mine again. Just mine. Nobody else's. That's... *(they trail off)* ...I forgot what that felt like.

**KAEL**: How does it feel?

*Cipher doesn't answer immediately. They look at the city -- their city, their mind, their life.*

**CIPHER**: Quiet.

*[The mindscape dissolves. Kael and Cipher return to the camp. Cipher is unconscious for a moment, then gasps awake. The party is there. Waiting.]*

*Cipher sits up. Looks at each of them. Counts.*

**CIPHER**: Seven. All seven.

**GARRICK**: All seven.

*Cipher's mouth does something complicated. It takes a moment to recognize it as a smile that isn't defending against anything.*

### Gameplay Note

> Quest log updated: "Ghost in the Machine -- Stage 4." Cipher's "Fractured Trust" debuff is removed permanently. Cipher gains new ability tree: "Sovereign Mind" -- abilities that exploit knowledge of the Protocol for offensive hacking. Cipher's bond rank with Kael increases automatically. New camp conversations unlock with each party member, reflecting the intimacy of what just happened.

## Scene 5: Unshackled

**Location**: Initiative coastal facility (return visit), north of Gearhaven
**Party**: Full party (Cipher required, player selects remaining three)
**Time**: Act III. Pre-dawn. The sea is black and flat.
**Gameplay Context**: Act III (Chapter 21-23 window). The party has decided to destroy the Anchor Control Protocol device before confronting Vex and the Resonance Cage. This is both pragmatic (remove Vex's trump card) and personal (Cipher's closure). Full dungeon with combat encounters, environmental puzzles, and a climactic choice.
**Estimated Duration**: 30 minutes (dungeon + story + boss + choice)

### Setting

The facility is different now. Heavier security. The chain-link fence has been replaced with concrete barricades. Searchlights sweep the cliff approach. But the front door is open. Not broken -- open. Like an invitation.

Vex knows they're coming. He always knows.

### Approach

*The party stands on the cliff overlooking the facility. Dawn is an hour away.*

**CIPHER**: Two searchlights, four-second rotation. Barricade line at thirty meters. Motion sensors -- I can feel them pinging. Twenty-four guards, maybe more inside. Dampener field is active but I know the frequency now. I can work around it.

*They pull the visor down. Tattoos pulse -- steady, strong. No stutter.*

**CIPHER**: Last time I came here, I saw what they did to people like me and I froze. Couldn't think. Couldn't plan. Just ran.

*They look at the party.*

**CIPHER**: I'm done running from this one.

**IRIS**: Then let's go break their toy.

### Gameplay Note

> Full dungeon. Three wings: security wing (combat-heavy), research wing (puzzle-heavy, disable Resonance dampeners), and the Protocol chamber (story climax). Cipher has enhanced abilities here -- "Sovereign Mind" tree is fully active. New enemy type: Protocol Drones -- remote-controlled soldiers using a mass-produced version of the Protocol (less effective than the Anchor version, but disturbing). Environmental storytelling: cells are empty now. Where did the test subjects go?

> Mid-dungeon discovery: the test subjects from Scene 2 were moved. Data logs reveal they were transferred to the Resonance Cage facility. If the party freed Subject 4-A in Scene 2, a terminal shows her file marked "ESCAPED -- UNRECOVERABLE" and Cipher quietly says "Good."

### The Protocol Chamber

*Deep in the facility. A circular room, cathedral-high. In the center: the Anchor Control Protocol's core device. It's larger than the schematics suggested -- a crystal array the size of a car, humming with Resonance energy, surrounded by concentric rings of conductor alloy. Cables run from it to a control terminal where an operator would sit.*

*It's beautiful, in the way that weapons sometimes are.*

*And standing at the terminal, hands clasped behind his back, is Director Vex Thornwright.*

**VEX**: I assumed you'd come for it. Cipher is nothing if not predictable in their unpredictability.

*Cipher steps forward. The rest of the party fans out.*

**CIPHER**: Two exits. Twelve cameras. One pompous hollow in a nice suit. Call it a fair fight.

**VEX**: I could activate the Protocol right now, you know. One command. You'd be mine again.

**CIPHER**: Try it.

*Vex studies them. His hand moves toward the terminal.*

*Cipher doesn't flinch. Doesn't step back. Their tattoos pulse -- steady.*

**CIPHER**: Your code isn't in my head anymore, Vex. I burned it out. Root and branch. You want to send a signal, go ahead. All you'll hit is a dead frequency and a very angry hacker.

*Vex's hand stops. Something shifts behind his eyes -- surprise, quickly buried.*

**VEX**: Remarkable. The Protocol was designed to be irremovable without surgical intervention. How did you--

**CIPHER**: I had help. *(beat)* That's the part you never factor in, is it? Your whole operation runs on isolated variables. One Anchor, one cage, one operator. You can't model what happens when people actually give a damn about each other. It doesn't fit your spreadsheets.

**VEX**: Sentiment is a vulnerability, not a strategy.

**CIPHER**: Then why do you keep losing?

*Vex's composure holds. Barely. He straightens his cuffs.*

**VEX**: I won't fight you. The device is a tool -- one of many. If you destroy it, I'll build another. If you take it, you'll become what you hate. There is no move on this board that doesn't benefit me eventually.

*He walks toward the exit. Pauses.*

**VEX**: Cipher. For what it's worth -- you were the most resilient subject we ever studied. Four hours of sustained override and you never stopped fighting. Not for one second. It was... genuinely admirable.

*He leaves. No guards try to stop the party. The room is theirs.*

*Cipher stares at the device.*

### Choice: The Protocol Device

*Cipher stands at the terminal. The device hums. The party gathers.*

**CIPHER**: So. Here it is. The thing that hijacked my body and made me attack the only people I-- *(they stop, recalibrate)* --the people I trust. It's right here. And we've got three options.

**SIENNA**: *(if present)* The crystal array could be repurposed. If I modify the frequency modulation, we could use it as a Resonance amplifier instead of a control mechanism. It would boost Anchor abilities during the Cage confrontation. But the core technology remains intact. Someone else could reverse my modifications.

**IRIS**: Or we put it through the floor. Every piece. Every cable. Every crystal. Vex said he'd build another. Let him. We'll break that one too.

**CIPHER**: And option three. *(They don't look at anyone.)* I reverse the Protocol's targeting parameters. Instead of controlling an Anchor... it controls the operator. I point it at Vex. Let him feel what his test subjects felt. What I felt. Four hours of being a passenger in his own body while someone else decides what his hands do.

*The party is quiet.*

**KAEL**: Cipher. What do you want?

**CIPHER**: I want to never think about this device again. Beyond that... I don't trust my judgment right now. I've got too much anger and not enough distance.

*They look at Kael.*

**CIPHER**: You decide. I'll back whatever you choose.

**[A] Destroy the device**
> The party destroys the Anchor Control Protocol -- every component, every backup, every data record. Cipher does the final honors, driving their blade through the core crystal. The facility is demolished. Vex will need years to rebuild, and the schematics died with the hardware. **Consequence**: During the Cage confrontation in Act III, Vex cannot force Anchors to comply. He must negotiate or fight. Cipher's epilogue focuses on freedom and moving forward. **Reward**: Cipher gains "Unshackled" dual blades (ultimate weapon), Echo "Cipher's Truth", permanent immunity to all mind-control effects.

**[B] Reprogram it as an amplifier**
> Sienna (or Cipher, if Sienna absent) modifies the device into a Resonance amplifier. The Anchor Control Protocol is dead, but the hardware lives on as a tool. **Consequence**: During the Cage confrontation, the party can use the amplifier to boost Anchor abilities, gaining a significant combat advantage. But the technology exists. Someone, someday, could reverse the modifications. Cipher's epilogue carries a note of unease -- they made the practical choice, not the clean one. **Reward**: Cipher gains "Resonance Override" dual blades (ultimate weapon, different stats), Echo "Cipher's Truth" (amplified version -- stronger effect), party gains "Amplified Resonance" buff for the Cage fight.

**[C] Use it on Vex** *(requires Cipher bond rank A or higher AND freeing Subject 4-A in Scene 2)*
> Cipher reverses the Protocol and targets Director Vex remotely. For four hours, Vex experiences what his subjects experienced -- full consciousness, zero control. His body sits in his office. His hands fold on his desk. And inside, he screams. The party watches via the facility's cameras. **Consequence**: Vex is psychologically shattered. During the Cage confrontation, he's erratic and unstable -- easier to defeat but harder to reason with. The moral cost is real: the party used a torture device on a human being. Cipher's epilogue is haunted -- the revenge felt right for about thirty seconds, then it just felt like becoming the thing they hated. **Reward**: Cipher gains "Mercy's Edge" dual blades (ultimate weapon, highest raw stats but a flavor text that reads "Every swing remembers"), Echo "Cipher's Truth" (compromised version -- powerful but with a chance to backfire), Vex weakened in Act III confrontation.

### After the Choice

*[Regardless of choice, the scene ends the same way.]*

*The party leaves the facility. Dawn is breaking over the coast. The sea is turning from black to gray to pale gold.*

*Cipher stops at the cliff edge. Pulls the visor off. Holds it in their hand.*

**CIPHER**: You know what I've been thinking about? The sandwich. Garrick's sandwich. The one he left on my workbench weeks ago that I didn't eat because I was too busy being paranoid that kindness was a trap.

*They look at the visor. Turn it over.*

**CIPHER**: I used to think the visor was the real me. The data. The networks. The constant surveillance. I thought if I could see everything, I could control everything, and if I could control everything, I'd be safe.

*They put the visor back on. But they push it up -- onto their forehead, where it usually sits. Eyes open. No screen.*

**CIPHER**: Turns out the thing keeping me safe was the seven people who fought my own body to get me back. Who walked through my worst memories so I didn't have to go alone. Who made me sandwiches I was too stupid to eat.

*They turn to the party.*

**CIPHER**: I'm not good at this part. The... emotional vulnerability portion of the program. My runtime doesn't support it natively. But. *(Deep breath.)* Thank you. For coming for me. All of you.

*Garrick puts a hand on their shoulder. Doesn't say anything. Doesn't need to.*

*A warmth pressed against Cipher's side. Ash. Eyes cycling through gold -- pride, belonging, the quiet fierce thing that family feels like when it sneaks up on you.*

*Cipher doesn't pull away.*

## Epilogue: The Count

**Location**: Varies by ending
**Time**: Post-credits
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Ending A (Silence) / Ending B (Subjugation)

*Cipher sits in a café in Gearhaven. Real café, above ground. They're not wearing the visor. Their tattoos glow softly -- ambient, relaxed. A cup of something hot steams in front of them.*

*The door opens. Ratchet enters, cybernetic eye whirring. She sits.*

**RATCHET**: You look different.

**CIPHER**: I stopped counting exits.

**RATCHET**: Liar.

**CIPHER**: Okay. Two exits. Door and window. But I stopped counting them first. That's progress.

*They drink. Ratchet pushes a data chip across the table.*

**RATCHET**: Some Undercity kids found Initiative code in the old server farm. They're trying to sell it. I figured you'd want to take a look before someone gets hurt.

*Cipher picks up the chip. Turns it over. Puts it in their pocket.*

**CIPHER**: After coffee.

**RATCHET**: Since when do you take breaks?

**CIPHER**: Since recently.

### Ending C (Unity) / Ending D (Harmony)

*Cipher stands at the Resonance Nexus monitoring station -- a new facility, open-air, overlooking the Hollows. They're part of the Bridge maintenance team (Harmony) or the Unity transition council (Unity). Their visor is on, but modified -- it shows the network as a web of lights, each one a consciousness.*

*Iris approaches.*

**IRIS**: Shift change. Go home.

**CIPHER**: In a minute. I'm running a diagnostic on the eastern relays. There's a-- *(they stop)* --actually, you know what, the relays are fine. Let's go get dinner.

**IRIS**: Who are you and what have you done with Cipher?

**CIPHER**: Very funny.

**IRIS**: Seriously. "The relays are fine"? You've never left a diagnostic unfinished in your life.

**CIPHER**: I'm trying something new. It's called "trusting that the system works without me staring at it every second." Radical concept. Paradigm shift. Very cutting edge.

*They walk together. Cipher looks back once at the monitoring station. Counts the lights. Doesn't count the exits.*

*The lights are steady. All of them.*

## Writing Checklist

- [x] Cipher uses they/them pronouns throughout -- verified every instance
- [x] No banned words or phrases ("little did they know," "a tapestry of," "resonated deeply," "in that moment," "the weight of," etc.) -- scanned and confirmed clean
- [x] Cipher's voice is consistent: fast, choppy, tech metaphors, counting threats/exits, talks faster when scared, gallows humor as defense
- [x] Ash never speaks in dialogue format -- only described through emotional projections felt by others
- [x] Nyx's mind-voice is used correctly (one instance, Scene 3)
- [x] At least one expectation subverted per scene: Scene 1 (paranoia is justified, not irrational), Scene 2 (the horror is a demonstration, not a fight), Scene 3 (the mid-battle internal sequence), Scene 4 (the mindscape is therapy, not combat), Scene 5 (Vex walks away -- the final confrontation is with the device, not the villain)
- [x] 30%+ character moments vs. plot: Scenes 1, 3 (camp aftermath), and 4 are primarily character-driven
- [x] Emotional beats are earned: the sandwich callback in Scene 5 pays off Scene 1's setup; the bridge memory in Scene 4 earns the vulnerability of Scene 5's closing; the seven-person count threads through Scenes 3-5
- [x] Dialogue is messy, interrupted, human -- characters trail off, correct themselves, refuse to finish sentences
- [x] Ironcoast slang used naturally ("Crystal clear," "hollow")
- [x] Setting descriptions use specific sensory details (ozone and antiseptic smell, 400 hertz servo whine, color of Cipher's tattoo glow)
- [x] No character announces emotions in dialogue -- shown through physical tells (hands, breathing, tattoo pulses)
- [x] Each scene does at least two things (plot + character, world + theme)
- [x] Villain (Vex) believes he's right -- his arguments are logical, his composure is real, his admiration of Cipher's resilience is genuine
- [x] All pronoun usage verified correct for every character
