# Garrick's Personal Quest: Three Burns

**Quest Type**: Character Personal Quest (Major)
**Availability**: Act I Chapter 7 through Act III Chapter 25
**Length**: 5-7 hours across Acts I-III
**Prerequisites**: Garrick in party (from Chapter 4 onward)
**Emotional Arc**: Avoidance -> dread -> devastation -> impossible tenderness -> release

**Summary**: Garrick led three Shepherd purges in the Cindral Wastes. The third one killed his daughter Mara, who was working as a healer in a village he'd been ordered to cleanse. He didn't know she was there. She saw him. He killed her without seeing her face. Now her Echo exists somewhere in the Wastes -- fragmented, scared, remembering everything. Garrick must retrace the path of his worst act, piece together what happened that day from the memories of the dead, and face the only person whose forgiveness he wants and doesn't deserve.

**Connection to Main Story**: Garrick's arc with Prophet Null parallels this quest. Both are about faith twisted into violence. Garrick's resolution here determines his emotional state during the Ch22 Cathedral confrontation and whether he can offer Null mercy or only judgment.

## Scene 1: The Name on the Wall

**Location**: Emberhearth, Ash Walker memorial wall
**Party**: Garrick and Kael
**Time**: Evening. The caldera is cooling. Orange light from the deep vents.
**Gameplay Context**: Triggered by examining the memorial wall in Emberhearth (Chapter 14 or 16). The wall lists names of people lost to Shepherd purges.
**Estimated Duration**: 8 minutes

### Setting

A wall of volcanic stone near the Forge Quarter, carved with names. Hundreds of them. Each name surrounded by a small geometric pattern -- the Ash Walker tradition for honoring the dead. Some names are old, weathered. Some are fresh.

Garrick stands before the wall. He hasn't moved in twenty minutes.

### The Name

*Kael approaches. Garrick doesn't acknowledge them.*

*Kael looks at the wall. Finds where Garrick is staring. One name, mid-wall, surrounded by a healer's geometric pattern -- interlocking circles.*

*MARA THORNE. 284 PS. CINDRAL WASTES PURGE. HEALER.*

**KAEL**: *(quietly)* Garrick.

*Nothing.*

**KAEL**: Is that--

**GARRICK**: My daughter. *(The words come out like stones dropping into water.)* She was sixteen.

*Kael says nothing. Waits.*

**GARRICK**: I haven't spoken her name out loud in fourteen years. I've said it in my head every morning. Every night. But never out loud. If I said it out loud, someone might ask who she was, and I'd have to explain what I did.

*He touches the wall. His fingers trace the healer's pattern.*

**GARRICK**: She wanted to be a healer. She left the Shepherd compound when she was fourteen because the doctrine said Resonance-touched people weren't worthy of medical care. She argued with the elders. They told her to submit. She told them to go to hell. My daughter, fourteen years old, telling the Shepherd Council to go to hell. *(Almost a smile. Almost.)* She got that from her mother.

**KAEL**: What happened?

**GARRICK**: She came to the Wastes. Found an Ash Walker village that took in refugees -- people with low-level Resonance corruption, the kind the Shepherds called "tainted." She became their healer. She was good at it. She was good at everything she cared about.

*His voice is steady. Controlled. The steadiness of a man who has practiced this story in his head ten thousand times.*

**GARRICK**: Two years later, the Council ordered a purge of Resonance-corrupted settlements in the Wastes. Three villages. I led the operation. I was Shepherd Commander Thorne. The Council's hammer. Three Burns, they called me after. Three villages. Three fires.

*He takes his hand off the wall.*

**GARRICK**: The third village was hers. I didn't know. The intelligence reports listed it as a "corrupted settlement" with "unknown number of sympathizers." They didn't list names. They never listed names.

### Gameplay Note

> Quest log updated: "Three Burns -- Stage 1." An Ash Walker elder approaches after the scene and tells Garrick that fragments of Mara's Echo have been sighted in the ruins of the third village -- a settlement called Ashpyre, in the deep Wastes. It was never rebuilt after the purge. The elder gives Garrick a fragment compass -- a crystal-tuned device that can locate specific Echoes by emotional resonance. "Find her, Three-Burns. You owe her that much."

## Scene 2: Following Smoke

**Location**: The Cindral Wastes, ruins of Ashpyre
**Party**: Garrick, Kael (required), one other
**Time**: Late afternoon. The heat is punishing. Ash in the air, even fourteen years later.
**Gameplay Context**: Triggered in Act II (Chapter 16-17 window). Overworld exploration leads to the ruined settlement.
**Estimated Duration**: 15 minutes (exploration + story)

### Setting

Ashpyre is a scar. Fourteen years of volcanic ash have buried the lower structures, but the stone walls still stand -- charred, cracked, silent. Crystal growths have colonized the ruins, feeding on residual Resonance. The village shrine -- a central fire pit surrounded by carved stones -- is cold. It hasn't burned since the purge.

Echoes flicker at the edges of perception. Memory fragments of the village's last day, replaying in loops. A woman carrying water. A child playing in dust. A healer mixing herbs.

### The Ruins

*Garrick walks through Ashpyre like a man walking through his own grave. He knows this place. He burned it.*

*The fragment compass pulses. Three Echoes remain in the village, fragments of Mara's consciousness scattered during the purge. Each one is a piece of her last day.*

### Fragment 1: The Morning

*Garrick touches the first Echo. It activates.*

*[Mara, sixteen, dark hair braided back, Garrick's jaw but softer. She's in the village clinic -- a tent, really, with shelves of herbs and crystal-treated bandages. A boy, maybe eight, sits on the treatment table with a scraped knee.]*

**MARA**: Hold still. This is going to sting, but only for a second.

**BOY**: Your dad was a Shepherd, right? My mom says Shepherds hate crystal healing.

**MARA**: My dad was a lot of things. He was wrong about some of them. *(She applies the crystal salve.)* There. All done. Go play, but stay away from the vent field. The ground's soft today.

*[The boy runs off. Mara watches him go. She's smiling. Then she looks at a letter on the desk -- unfinished, addressed to "Father." She picks up the pen. Puts it down. Picks it up.]*

*[The Echo fades.]*

*Garrick is on his knees in the ash. The compass clutched in both hands.*

**GARRICK**: She was writing to me. She was trying to-- *(He can't finish.)*

### Fragment 2: The Warning

*The second Echo is in the village center. It activates at Garrick's touch.*

*[Mara, running. The village alarm -- a crystal bell struck with a stone hammer. She reaches the elder, an old Ash Walker woman with geometric markings covering both arms.]*

**MARA**: How many?

**ELDER**: Three companies. Shepherd armor. They're burning the eastern approach.

**MARA**: Casualties?

**ELDER**: The scouts didn't come back.

*[Mara's face changes. Not fear -- calculation. She's thinking like a field medic.]*

**MARA**: We need to move the patients. The Resonance-sensitive ones -- if the Shepherds use purification bombs, the crystal backlash will--

**ELDER**: There's no time, child. They're already at the south gate.

*[Mara looks south. Through the village gates, visible in the haze: armored figures. White robes over plate. The Shepherd emblem on their shields -- the same emblem Garrick carries, scratched out.]*

*[One figure at the front. Tall. Barrel-chested. Gray even then. Carrying a shield that blazes with purification light.]*

*[Mara's hand goes to her mouth.]*

**MARA**: *(whispered)* Dad?

*[The Echo fractures. Fragments scatter.]*

*Garrick hasn't moved. His eyes are closed.*

**KAEL**: Garrick. We can stop. We don't have to--

**GARRICK**: We do. I have to see it. All of it. She saw it. The least I can do is look.

### Fragment 3: The Last Moment

*The third Echo is at the shrine. The cold fire pit. This one activates without being touched -- it was waiting.*

*[The village burns. The purification fire is white-hot, crystal-fueled, consuming everything with Resonance signature. Mara is in the clinic, hauling a patient -- an elderly man, too weak to walk -- toward the north exit. The roof is on fire.]*

*[A Shepherd soldier blocks the door. Young. Scared. Sword raised.]*

**MARA**: Please. He's just an old man. He's not corrupted. He just has crystal dust in his lungs from the mines. Please.

*[The soldier hesitates.]*

*[From outside, a command voice -- Garrick's voice, fourteen years younger, rough with certainty:]*

**GARRICK'S ECHO**: *(shouted)* No survivors in the contamination zone! Standard purification protocol!

*[The soldier's face hardens. He steps forward.]*

*[Mara puts herself between the soldier and the patient.]*

**MARA**: My name is Mara Thorne. My father is Commander Thorne. He's outside. If you let me speak to him--

*[The soldier doesn't hear. Or doesn't care. The purification fire reaches the clinic's crystal stores and the building detonates.]*

*[White light. Then nothing.]*

*[The Echo ends.]*

*Garrick is sitting in the ash. He's not crying. He's past that. He's in the place beyond tears where the body shuts down because the alternative is flying apart.*

*Nobody speaks. The ruined village is quiet. The wind blows ash across the cold shrine.*

*Eventually:*

**GARRICK**: She said my name. She tried to use my name to save them. And I was the one who gave the order that killed her.

*He puts his hands flat on the ground. Pushes himself up. His knees don't cooperate. He tries again. Kael reaches for him and he shakes the hand off.*

**GARRICK**: Don't. Not yet. Let me stand on my own.

*He stands. Barely.*

**GARRICK**: The compass. It's still pulling. She's not all here. There's more of her somewhere deeper in the Wastes. Whatever's left of her -- the part that's still conscious, if there is one -- it's further in.

## Scene 3: The Echo of Mara

**Location**: Volcanic ruins, deep Cindral Wastes -- a cave formed by cooled lava, where crystal growths have created a natural Echo chamber
**Party**: Garrick, Kael, Ash (Ash insists on coming -- they sense what's ahead)
**Time**: The deep Wastes have no time. The vents provide constant orange light.
**Gameplay Context**: Late Act II or early Act III. The fragment compass leads to this location.
**Estimated Duration**: 15 minutes

### Setting

A lava cave. The walls are smooth black stone veined with crystal. At the center: a formation that looks almost like a seated figure. The crystal is warm, alive, pulsing with a rhythm that Garrick recognizes. The rhythm of his daughter's heartbeat. He listened to it through the wall when she was a baby, timing his breathing to hers.

### The Meeting

*The cave is quiet except for the crystal's pulse. Garrick approaches alone. Kael and Ash wait at the entrance.*

*Garrick touches the crystal.*

*[Mara's Echo coalesces. Not a loop -- a consciousness. Like Lyra. She's been here for fourteen years, growing, remembering, becoming. She looks like she did at sixteen, but her eyes are older. Three-hundred years of the Hollows' influence, compressed into fourteen years of solitude.]*

*She sees him.*

*For a long time, neither of them speaks.*

**MARA**: ...You're old.

*Garrick makes a sound that might be a laugh and might be a sob.*

**GARRICK**: You're not.

**MARA**: No. I'm not anything, really. I'm the part that didn't burn. The part that the crystal caught before it was gone. I've been here... a long time.

**GARRICK**: Fourteen years.

**MARA**: Is that all? It felt longer. The cave doesn't have days. Just the pulse. I listened to the pulse and I thought about things. Mostly I thought about you.

*Garrick's hands are shaking. His whole body is shaking. The shield on his back -- the scratched emblem -- feels heavier than it's ever been.*

**GARRICK**: Mara, I--

**MARA**: I know what you're going to say. You've been practicing it for fourteen years. I could feel you, sometimes, through the crystal. Your guilt. It's the loudest thing in the Wastes. Louder than the vents. Louder than the Echoes. You wear it like armor.

**GARRICK**: It's not armor. It's a sentence.

**MARA**: I know. That's what I want to talk to you about. *(She sits in the crystal formation -- her throne, her prison, her home.)* You didn't know I was there. You didn't see me. You gave an order you'd given a hundred times, and this time the order killed your daughter. That's a horror, Dad. It's a real, genuine horror. But it's not the crime you've turned it into.

**GARRICK**: I burned three villages.

**MARA**: You did. And that IS the crime. Not the accident of killing me -- the choice of burning people. All of them. Every patient I treated. The elder who took me in. The boy with the scraped knee. You killed them because a council of frightened men told you they were contaminated, and you believed them because believing was easier than thinking.

*She looks at him with eyes that are both sixteen and ancient.*

**MARA**: I forgive you for killing me. You didn't know. But the forgiveness you actually need -- for the villages, for the years of not questioning, for the faith that was really just obedience -- that's not mine to give. That's yours.

**GARRICK**: I don't know how.

**MARA**: I know. That's why you're still carrying the shield with the scratched emblem instead of throwing it away. You scratch it out but you keep it. You punish yourself but you won't let go. You've turned guilt into a second religion, Dad. And it's just as blind as the first one.

### The Silence

*Garrick sits on the cave floor across from his daughter's Echo. The crystal pulses between them. Ash, at the entrance, sends a feeling into the cave: not comfort. Understanding. The specific understanding of a child who knows what it's like to be defined by forces you didn't choose.*

*Garrick removes the shield from his back. Sets it between them. The scratched emblem faces up.*

**GARRICK**: Your mother used to say I was the stubbornest man in the Wastes. She was right about most things.

**MARA**: She was right about that.

**GARRICK**: *(touching the scratched emblem)* I kept it because I was afraid that without it, I'd forget what I did. That I'd forgive myself and then I wouldn't have a reason to be different.

**MARA**: And how's that working?

**GARRICK**: *(a breath that's almost a laugh)* Terribly.

**MARA**: Dad. Listen to me. You don't need the emblem to remember. You cook for people who are scared. You build walls for strangers. You sit up at night so a shadow child can sleep. You put yourself between danger and everyone smaller than you. That's not guilt. That's who you are when you stop punishing yourself long enough to actually be someone.

### Choice: Garrick's Release

**[A] "Rest, Mara. You've been here long enough."**
> Garrick helps Mara's Echo dissolve. He uses the purification techniques the Shepherds taught him -- but gently, this time. Not burning. Releasing. Mara's consciousness dissipates into the crystal lattice, returning to the deep Resonance of the Wastes. She's gone. But the last thing she sends, through the crystal, into his chest: *peace. Not forgiveness -- that was already given. Peace.*
>
> *Reward*: "Mara's Rest" -- Garrick's ultimate shield. Absorbs damage and converts it to healing for adjacent allies. Garrick gains "Gentle Purification" ability: removes all debuffs from party without harming them.
>
> *Consequence*: Garrick is lighter in Act III. His faith conversation with Prophet Null in Ch22 is different -- he speaks from a place of release, not rage.

**[B] "Stay. As long as you want."**
> Garrick can't let go. He tells Mara he'll come back. He'll visit. He'll sit in this cave and talk to her whenever he can. Mara accepts -- she's lonely, she's been alone for fourteen years, and having her father back, even briefly, matters. The Echo stabilizes permanently.
>
> *Reward*: "Daughter's Vigil" -- Garrick's ultimate shield. Stronger than Mara's Rest in raw defense, but no healing conversion. Garrick gains "Mara's Blessing" passive: when Garrick drops below 25% HP, Mara's Echo intervenes once per battle (restores 50% HP, unique animation).
>
> *Consequence*: Garrick carries the visit like a promise. In Act III, his conviction is fiercer but more fragile. His confrontation with Null is more personal -- he's not just fighting a false prophet, he's fighting the ideology that separated him from his daughter.

**[C] "I want to carry you with me. If you'll let me."**
> Garrick asks Mara to merge with his Resonance. Not possession -- partnership. Her consciousness joins his, a presence in the back of his mind. A warmth. A voice that tells him to stop being stubborn and eat something. She agrees, laughing, because of course she does.
>
> *Reward*: "The Third Burn" -- Garrick's ultimate shield AND sword combination. The shield becomes a weapon when Garrick chooses to attack instead of defend. Garrick gains "Two Hearts" passive: permanent +15% to all stats, and Mara occasionally provides tactical advice in battle (hints at enemy weaknesses).
>
> *Consequence*: Garrick walks out of the cave changed. Warmer. Still quiet, but the silences are companionable instead of heavy. His stew in Act III is better. Mara has opinions about seasoning.

## Epilogue

*After the choice, Garrick returns to the party. If Kael asks how it went:*

**GARRICK**: *(after a long pause)* She's braver than me. Always was.

*He makes stew that night. It's the best stew he's ever made. Nobody asks why. Some things you don't need explained.*

*The shield stays on his back. But at the next camp, if anyone looks closely, the scratched emblem has been cleaned. Not restored -- just cleared of the old scratches. A blank space where the symbol used to be. Room for something new.*

**Quest Rewards Summary**:
- Garrick's ultimate equipment (form depends on choice)
- Garrick's unique ability (depends on choice)
- Unique Echo: "Garrick's Release" -- the moment he stopped punishing himself

- Modifies epilogue

**Writing Checklist**:
- [x] Garrick's voice: very short sentences, metaphorical, long pauses
- [x] No banned phrases
- [x] Mara is a person, not a device -- she has opinions, humor, anger
- [x] Ash Walker culture respected -- memorial wall, geometric patterns, fire symbolism
- [x] Cindral Wastes slang used (ember heart, ash walker, three-burns)
- [x] The emotional gut-punch is earned across three fragments before the confrontation
- [x] Ash's nonverbal presence adds without stealing focus
- [x] All three choices are valid -- none is clearly "best"
- [x] Garrick never announces his emotions. His body tells us everything.
