# Iris's Personal Quest: The Engineer's Oath

**Quest Type**: Character Personal Quest (Major)
**Availability**: Act I Chapter 4 through Act III Chapter 23
**Length**: 4-6 hours across Acts I-III
**Prerequisites**: Iris in party (from Chapter 3 onward)
**Emotional Arc**: Suspicion -> guilt -> fury -> impossible choice -> grief or hope

**Summary**: Iris deserted the Reclamation Initiative, but her brother Dane didn't. Intelligence trickles in -- Dane's been promoted, he's leading the unit hunting deserters, and he might be leading the Cage deployment force. Iris tracks his movements, infiltrates an outpost, and discovers the worst thing imaginable: he's not brainwashed. He genuinely believes the Initiative is humanity's best chance. The quest forces Iris to confront something harder than enemy soldiers -- a person she loves making choices she can't forgive, and the fact that her own hands built the tools he's using. Culminates in a brutal choice during Act III: save Dane or complete the mission.

**Connection to Main Story**: Dane leads the Cage deployment force in Act III (Ch20 confirms this). Iris's quest determines whether the Cage confrontation includes a personal dimension or is purely tactical.

## Scene 1: Blood on the Line

**Location**: Emberhearth, after the siege (Chapter 16)
**Party**: Kael and Iris
**Time**: Late morning, hot, the wall she's sitting on still has scorch marks
**Gameplay Context**: Triggered by approaching Iris on the wall after the siege. Connects to Ch16's character beat.
**Estimated Duration**: 7 minutes

### Setting

The damaged wall overlooking the Scorched Road. Iris has been up here since dawn with a folded letter Cipher intercepted from Initiative communications. The prosthetic hand rests on her knee, fingers tapping a cadence. One-two-three-four. Her brother's march rhythm.

### The Letter

*Kael finds her. Sits. Waits. Three full minutes pass.*

**IRIS**: Cipher pulled this off the Initiative comms net. It's a personnel transfer order. My brother Dane has been reassigned to Special Operations Command. My old unit. He's leading the team that's tracking us.

**KAEL**: I'm sorry.

**IRIS**: Don't be. He chose this. Nobody held a gun to his head and said "hunt your sister." He looked at the options and decided the Initiative was worth more than-- *(she stops. Folds the letter. Folds it again.)* He's twenty-three. I left when he was nineteen. Four years. Four years and they turned the kid who cried about a dead dog into a Special Operations Commander.

**KAEL**: Maybe they didn't turn him into anything. Maybe he grew up.

**IRIS**: Into someone who hunts people like me for a living. Yeah. Hell of a growth spurt.

*She pulls a data chip from her pocket.*

**IRIS**: There's more. The transfer order mentions a project codenamed IRONCLAD. Classified. But the deployment pattern suggests forward staging near the Hollows border. Whatever IRONCLAD is, Dane's been assigned to it personally.

**KAEL**: What do you want to do?

**IRIS**: I want to find out what they've given my brother. What weapon they've put in his hands that has my fingerprints somewhere in the design specs. Because everything the Initiative builds-- every gun, every cage, every dampener-- traces back to research I contributed to. My prosthetic arm uses the same Resonance channeling tech as their suppression weapons. Same patent. Same engineering.

*The prosthetic hand closes into a fist. The metal creaks.*

**IRIS**: I want to find IRONCLAD. And if Dane's involved, I want to look him in the eye and ask him if he knows what he's carrying.

### Gameplay Note

> Quest log updated: "The Engineer's Oath -- Stage 1." Side objective unlocked: "Investigate IRONCLAD." Cipher can scan Initiative frequencies at any camp for additional intelligence (random chance of intercepting relevant communications each time). Iris gains the passive ability "Tracking Dane" -- Initiative-related environmental clues are highlighted during exploration.

---

## Scene 2: The Workshop

**Location**: Abandoned Initiative forward post, Crystalline Steppes
**Party**: Kael, Iris, Cipher (required)
**Time**: Night. Infiltration mission.
**Gameplay Context**: Triggered in Act II (Chapter 16-17 window). Cipher has triangulated the location of an abandoned Initiative outpost with IRONCLAD data.
**Estimated Duration**: 15 minutes (stealth/exploration + story)

### Setting

A prefab Initiative facility in the Steppes, recently evacuated. Signs of hasty departure -- half-eaten meals, personal items left behind, a chess game mid-play. The power is still on. The data terminals are wiped... mostly.

### Infiltration

*Cipher works the terminal. Iris watches the door. Kael watches Iris.*

**CIPHER**: Security wipe was sloppy. They killed the primary databases but left the maintenance logs. Maintenance logs tell you everything -- what was shipped in, what was shipped out, what broke, what got fixed. Nobody thinks to wipe the janitor's notes.

*Their tattoos pulse as they pull data.*

**CIPHER**: IRONCLAD. Here it is. It's not a weapon. It's a-- *(they stop typing)* --it's a mobile deployment platform for the Resonance Cage. They've miniaturized the Cage components into a field-deployable unit. Six vehicles. Twelve operators. And a command module that requires-- *(reading)* --a Resonance-sensitive pilot to calibrate the containment field in real-time.

**IRIS**: A Resonance-sensitive pilot.

**CIPHER**: Someone with prosthetic Resonance integration. Someone whose nervous system can interface directly with the Cage's frequency modulation. Someone like--

**IRIS**: Like me. Or like my brother.

*She pulls up a maintenance photo on the terminal. A vehicle. Sleek, armored, with a cockpit that's more surgery theater than driver's seat. Neural interface cables. Resonance dampener arrays. The Cage, made mobile.*

**IRIS**: I designed that cockpit interface. Four years ago. A prototype for medical applications -- neural-linked prosthetic calibration for amputees. Supposed to help people with new arms learn to use them faster. *(Her voice flattens.)* They turned it into a weapons platform. They always turn it into a weapons platform.

**CIPHER**: The operator roster lists one name for the command module: Commander D. Mantle.

*Iris stares at the screen.*

**IRIS**: He volunteered. He would have volunteered. Dane always volunteers.

**KAEL**: Iris. What do you need?

**IRIS**: I need to know if my brother is the kind of person who'll deploy a consciousness-imprisonment device and sleep fine afterward. *(Beat.)* And I need to know if I'm the kind of person who built him the tools to do it.

### Gameplay Note

> Quest log updated: "The Engineer's Oath -- Stage 2." IRONCLAD specs added to Key Items. Iris gains the ability "Cage Analysis: IRONCLAD" -- when deployed in Act III, she can identify and target IRONCLAD's mobile Cage components. Cipher can decrypt additional IRONCLAD deployment orders at subsequent camps.

## Scene 3: The Sister's Frequency

**Location**: Initiative forward staging area, northern Steppes (optional infiltration, Act II late)
**Party**: Kael, Iris (required), one other
**Time**: Dusk. The staging area is active -- patrols, vehicles, the hum of Resonance equipment.
**Gameplay Context**: High-risk optional scene. Iris insists on getting close to the staging area to attempt encrypted communication with Dane. If the player accepts, stealth mission. If declined, Iris goes alone and returns injured.
**Estimated Duration**: 12 minutes

### Setting

A ridge overlooking the Initiative staging area. Below: thirty vehicles, three hundred soldiers, and the IRONCLAD command module -- a dark, angular vehicle bristling with antenna arrays. In the command module's cockpit window, a light. Someone's working late.

### The Transmission

*Iris has rigged her prosthetic to broadcast on a specific Initiative encryption frequency -- one she and Dane used to use as children, piggybacking on military comms to send each other coded messages.*

**IRIS**: It was our game. When he was twelve and I was seventeen. I was already in the Initiative engineering corps. He was in military school. We'd send each other encrypted messages through the base communication system. Drive our CO insane. *(She adjusts the prosthetic's broadcast antenna.)* Same frequency. Same cipher. If he hasn't changed it...

*She transmits. Three short pulses, two long. Their childhood call sign.*

*Silence. Thirty seconds. A minute. Iris's jaw tightens.*

*Then: two short, three long. The response.*

**IRIS**: *(exhaling)* He's there.

*She transmits: plain text, encrypted with the childhood cipher.*

**IRIS**: *(speaking as she types)* "Songbird to Ironwing. I'm here. I know about IRONCLAD. I know what you're deploying. Please talk to me."

*The response comes slowly. Character by character.*

**DANE** *(text display on Iris's prosthetic)*: "Ironwing to Songbird. You shouldn't be here. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. They know you're with the Anchor group. If they trace this signal--"

**IRIS**: *(typing)* "I need five minutes. That's all. Five minutes and then I'm gone."

*Long pause.*

**DANE**: "Three minutes. Starting now."

**IRIS**: *(typing fast)* "The Cage. Do you know what it does? Not the briefing version. Do you know what it actually does to people."

**DANE**: "It contains the Convergence. Prevents uncontrolled reformation. Saves lives."

**IRIS**: "It strips consciousness. Dane. I've seen the schematics. It uses human minds as bait. It peels people apart and feeds their awareness into a containment matrix. That's not saving anyone. That's the worst thing I've ever seen on a spec sheet and I helped design suppression weapons."

*No response for twenty seconds.*

**DANE**: "Director Thornwright showed us the projections. Uncontrolled Convergence reformation kills 4.2 billion people. The Cage saves everyone except the containment subjects. 847 lives for 4.2 billion. The math works."

**IRIS**: *(out loud, not typing)* Oh, Dane.

*She stares at the screen. Types:*

**IRIS**: "You sound like him. You sound just like him. 'Development costs.' That's what he calls the people in his labs. Development costs."

**DANE**: "I'm not him, Iris. I'm a soldier. I follow the plan that saves the most people."

**IRIS**: "And if the plan is wrong?"

**DANE**: "Then we fix it. From inside. Where we can actually change things. Not from outside throwing rocks."

*The timer on Iris's prosthetic hits zero. The channel auto-terminates.*

*Iris sits on the ridge. The staging area hums below. Somewhere in that command module, her brother is sitting alone with the same conversation she's having with herself.*

**IRIS**: He's not wrong. *(To Kael.)* That's the worst part. He's not wrong about the math. He's wrong about the premise. The premise is that the Cage is the only option. But if you accept the premise, the math works. He's a good soldier following a rational plan. And I'm going to have to stop him.

### Gameplay Note

> Quest log updated: "The Engineer's Oath -- Stage 3." Iris's Bond with Kael increases. If this scene is completed, Iris has additional dialogue options during the Act III Cage confrontation (she can attempt to reach Dane through the childhood cipher during the battle, creating a non-combat resolution path). If skipped, the Cage confrontation is combat-only.

---

## Scene 4: The Sister's Choice

**Location**: Act III -- during the Cage deployment confrontation (Chapter 23)
**Party**: Full party (split mission -- Iris must choose her team)
**Time**: Dawn. The IRONCLAD convoy is deploying toward the Nexus entrance.
**Gameplay Context**: This is the quest's climax, integrated into the main story's Act III Cage confrontation. The party must both disable the Cage AND deal with Dane.
**Estimated Duration**: 15 minutes

### Setting

The northern Steppes. The Hollows border is visible -- that wrong horizon, close now. The IRONCLAD convoy rolls toward it: six vehicles in formation, the command module at the center, three hundred soldiers in escort. And in the cockpit of the command module, a young man with Iris's jaw and their mother's hands, calibrating a device that will imprison a dying god.

### The Split

*The party must divide. One team attacks the Cage's crystal array (Sienna's expertise). One team deals with the convoy escort (combat). And someone has to reach the command module. Where Dane is.*

**IRIS**: I'm going to the module.

**KAEL**: Iris--

**IRIS**: Don't. I know what you're going to say. "It's too personal. You can't be objective." You're right. I can't. But nobody else can reach him. Nobody else knows the frequency. Nobody else can get close enough to the cockpit without triggering the auto-defense, because the biometric lock is keyed to Mantle DNA and I share half of it.

*She holds up the prosthetic.*

**IRIS**: This arm interfaces with Initiative tech. It's the same architecture as the IRONCLAD cockpit. I can override the calibration from inside. I can shut the whole thing down. But I need to be in the cockpit, and Dane will be in the cockpit, and one of us is going to have to give.

### The Command Module

*Iris enters the module. The interior is exactly like the maintenance photos -- a surgery theater on wheels. Neural interface cables. Screens showing Resonance frequency data. And Dane, strapped into the pilot chair, cables running from his spine to the Cage calibration array.*

*He sees her. His face goes through five emotions in two seconds.*

**DANE**: Iris. Get out. The auto-defense--

**IRIS**: I bypassed it. Mantle DNA. Thanks, Mom.

*She looks at the cables in his spine. The interface points. Her own prosthetic was built on the same design.*

**IRIS**: Look at you. They wired you in. My neural interface spec, Dane. The one I designed for amputee rehabilitation. They put it in your spine and plugged you into a weapon.

**DANE**: I volunteered.

**IRIS**: I know you did. You always volunteer.

*She stands across from him. Brother and sister. Same jaw. Same stubbornness. Different sides of a war neither of them started.*

**DANE**: You can't stop it from here. The Cage is already charging. The crystal array is live. If you pull the interface cables, the calibration fails and the containment matrix collapses uncontrolled -- everyone in the staging area, everyone within a kilometer, the Resonance feedback will--

**IRIS**: I'm not going to pull the cables. I'm going to sit down, plug my arm into the secondary port, and counter-calibrate the frequency until the array destabilizes safely. Sienna showed me how. It'll take four minutes.

**DANE**: In four minutes, the Cage will have contained the Convergence. The mission will be complete. Billions saved.

**IRIS**: Billions saved and a consciousness enslaved. That's not salvation, Dane. That's what the Shepherds call purification with a different coat of paint.

*She sits in the secondary chair. Extends her prosthetic toward the interface port.*

**DANE**: Iris. Don't.

**IRIS**: I'm sorry.

**DANE**: I said don't!

*He grabs her arm. The real one, the right one. His hand is shaking.*

**DANE**: I can't let you destroy this. Do you understand? This is the plan. This is how we save everyone. If you take this away, there's nothing left. The Convergence reforms and swallows us all. Four billion people, Iris. Our parents. Everyone we grew up with.

**IRIS**: Our parents are dead, Dane. They died in a Resonance collapse seven years ago. The same kind of collapse the Initiative causes every time they run an extraction operation. The math you keep citing -- the 4.2 billion -- that's Vex's projection. And Vex counts people in spreadsheets.

*She looks at him.*

**IRIS**: I'm not asking you to trust me. I'm asking you to look at the cables in your back. Cables I designed for healing, that they put in you for war. And ask yourself: if I was wrong about the design, was he right about the mission?

### Choice: The Sister's Choice

**[A] Disable the Cage (prioritize mission)**
> Iris plugs in and counter-calibrates. The Cage destabilizes safely. Dane's interface overloads -- he's injured but alive. He'll be evacuated by Initiative medics. Their relationship may never recover, but the Cage is neutralized. Iris walks out of the module and doesn't look back.
>
> *Reward*: "Liberator's Hammer" -- Iris's ultimate weapon. Built from IRONCLAD components she salvaged. Massive damage, bonus against Initiative tech. Iris gains "The Oath" passive: +20% damage when defending allies.
>
> *Consequence*: Dane survives but is captured by the Initiative during retreat. He appears in the epilogue as a prisoner or refugee depending on the ending.

**[B] Save Dane first, then disable the Cage (risky)**
> Iris unplugs Dane's cables first, risking uncontrolled calibration feedback. Dane resists, then relents. The extra time means the Cage partially activates before Iris can counter-calibrate -- some damage occurs, and the party faces a harder subsequent battle. But Dane is free, uninjured, and shaken.
>
> *Reward*: "Sister's Burden" -- Iris's ultimate weapon. Lower raw damage but heals Iris when she protects allies. Iris gains "Blood Bond" passive: if Dane survived and was freed, he appears as an NPC ally in the final dungeon.
>
> *Consequence*: Dane defects from the Initiative. In the epilogue, he's rebuilding. Slower. Different. Still building things, but asking what they're for now.

**[C] Let Dane make the choice (if Stage 3 was completed)**
> Iris transmits on their childhood frequency. Three short, two long. Their old call sign. She doesn't argue, doesn't fight. She just sends: "Ironwing. What do we do?" Dane looks at the cables. Looks at his sister. And for the first time in four years, he doesn't follow orders. He pulls his own plugs. The Cage destabilizes. They disable it together. Four minutes, shoulder to shoulder, like kids playing with encrypted messages.
>
> *Reward*: "The Engineers" -- a paired weapon set. Iris and Dane each wield one half. Iris's half is stronger when Dane is in the party as an NPC ally. Iris gains "Two Mantles" passive: Dane joins as a temporary party member for the final dungeon.
>
> *Consequence*: Best outcome. Dane joins as an NPC ally for the finale. In the epilogue, the siblings are rebuilding together -- arguing about structural integrity, same as always.

---

## Epilogue

*After the Cage confrontation, regardless of choice, Iris sits alone. She takes the folded letter -- Dane's transfer order -- from her pocket. Reads it one more time.*

*If she chose the mission: she folds it smaller, tighter, until it's the size of a coin. Puts it back in her pocket. Doesn't throw it away. Can't.*

*If she saved Dane: she unfolds it flat, smooths the creases, and writes on the back: "COME HOME." Leaves it where he'll find it.*

*If Dane chose himself: she tears it in half. Gives one half to Dane. Keeps the other. They don't need the old orders anymore.*

---
