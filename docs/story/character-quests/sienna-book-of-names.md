# Sienna's Personal Quest: The Book of Names

**Quest Type**: Character Personal Quest (Major)
**Availability**: Act II Chapter 16 through Act III Chapter 25
**Length**: 4-6 hours across Acts II-III
**Prerequisites**: Sienna in party (from Chapter 13 onward); must have visited Station Theta containment wing
**Emotional Arc**: Clinical detachment -> forced confrontation -> desperate hope -> shattered calculus -> raw acceptance

**Summary**: Since before she defected, Sienna has carried a small leather notebook. She writes in it after every patient she treats, every person she helps. But the first fifty-three pages are different. They contain the name, age, former occupation, and conversion date of every person she transformed into a Resonance battery. Fifty-three names. Fifty-three people she reduced to power cells in service of her brother's Cage. When the party discovers the book, it triggers a quest that takes Sienna across the Ironcoast to find the survivors -- the ones who are still alive in their crystal prisons, still conscious, still waiting. She's been secretly developing a reversal protocol. It has never been tested on a living subject. The question is not whether she can undo what she did. The question is whether the attempt will kill more people than the disease.

**Connection to Main Story**: Sienna's reversal research directly informs the party's ability to dismantle the Resonance Cage in Act III. If she perfects the extraction protocol, the Cage prisoners in Ch23 can be freed. If she destroys her research, the party must find another way. If she keeps working in secret, the protocol exists but is unreliable -- some Cage prisoners live, some don't. Her emotional state here also determines her dialogue during the confrontation with Director Vex (Ch23) and whether she can face him as a sister or only as an enemy.

## Scene 1: The Ledger

**Location**: Emberhearth, temporary clinic in the Forge Quarter
**Party**: Kael and Sienna (Iris enters mid-scene)
**Time**: Late evening. The clinic is closed. Orange vent-light through the windows. The smell of volcanic sulfur and antiseptic.
**Gameplay Context**: Triggered during Chapter 16's open exploration phase. The player approaches Sienna in the clinic after hours. She's at her desk. She's been there since the last patient left, four hours ago.
**Estimated Duration**: 10 minutes

### Setting

The clinic is a converted smithy -- Sienna commandeered it three days after the siege, stripped the forge equipment to the walls, and installed treatment tables built from salvaged wood. Crystal-powered sterilization lamps line the ceiling. The walls still have scorch marks from the forge. It smells like hot metal and iodine and something faintly sweet that might be the Resonance stabilizer she uses in her treatments.

Sienna is at the desk in the back corner. A small leather notebook is open in front of her, and she's writing with a pen that shakes in her grip. She doesn't hear Kael come in.

### The Discovery

*Kael approaches. Sienna doesn't look up. Her pen scratches across the page -- careful letters, clinical hand, but the lines waver where the tremor catches.*

**KAEL**: Sienna? It's past midnight.

*She startles. Her hand jerks. A line of ink drags across the page.*

**SIENNA**: I'm -- yes. I lost track of time. It happens. When I'm documenting.

**KAEL**: Documenting what?

*She closes the notebook. Too fast. Her hand covers it.*

**SIENNA**: Patient records. Today's intake. Nothing that requires -- it's clinical data.

**KAEL**: You treated six people today. You've been writing for four hours.

*Sienna's mouth opens. Closes. She looks at the notebook under her hand and something shifts behind her glasses -- the professional mask slipping half a degree.*

**SIENNA**: Sit down, Kael.

*Kael sits on the edge of a treatment table. Sienna picks up the notebook. Holds it in both hands. Her thumbs run along the spine -- an old gesture, worn into reflex.*

**SIENNA**: When I was at the Initiative, I kept records. Official ones -- subject numbers, conversion metrics, Resonance yield data. Clean data. The kind you put in reports.

*She opens the notebook to the first page.*

**SIENNA**: This isn't the official record.

*She turns the book so Kael can see.*

*The page is divided into columns, filled in by hand. Name. Age. Occupation. Date of conversion. Notes.*

*Line one: "Marcus Theel. 34. Elementary school teacher. 291 PS. Survived conversion. Cognitive function: minimal. Last verified status: Station Theta, Cell 1."*

*Line two: "Rina Vosh. 22. Dock worker, Gearhaven harbor. 291 PS. Survived conversion. Last verified status: Station Theta, Cell 2."*

*Line three. Line four. Line five. The list continues, page after page, in that same shaking handwriting.*

**SIENNA**: Fifty-three names. Every person I converted into a Resonance battery. Every single one.

*She flips past the list. The pages after are different -- newer entries, cleaner ink, same columns but different headings. Name. Ailment. Treatment. Outcome.*

**SIENNA**: The first fifty-three pages are the people I destroyed. Everything after that is the people I've treated since I left. Eighty-nine, as of today. I write every name. I will write every name I touch for the rest of my life, because there was a period when I used numbers instead, and that's -- that's how it starts. That's how you stop seeing faces.

**KAEL**: Sienna...

**SIENNA**: Don't. I'm not telling you this for comfort. I'm telling you because you need to understand the scope of what I did. Fifty-three people. Not abstractions. Not "subjects." Marcus Theel wanted to teach children about pre-Severance history. Rina Vosh had a sister she sent money to every month. Tomás Gren -- *she turns a page* -- seventeen years old, apprentice mechanic, terrible sense of humor, told me a joke about a broken airship while I was prepping the conversion chamber. While I was strapping him in. He told me a joke.

*Her voice cracks. The clinical tone holds for one more sentence, then doesn't.*

**SIENNA**: He told me a joke and I laughed and then I turned him into a battery.

*Silence. The vent-light pulses. Somewhere in the city, a hammer falls on an anvil.*

### Iris Enters

*The clinic door opens. Iris stands in the doorway. She's been outside. It's unclear how long.*

**IRIS**: I heard you from the street. These walls are thin.

*Sienna stiffens. The notebook stays open on the desk.*

**IRIS**: Fifty-three.

**SIENNA**: Fifty-three.

*Iris walks to the desk. Looks down at the notebook. Her prosthetic hand rests on the desk's edge -- the metal fingers flat, controlled, deliberate.*

**IRIS**: I transported twelve of those people. My unit. Before I knew what the program was.

*She reads a name from the list. Her finger -- the flesh one -- stops on a line.*

**IRIS**: Pel Dorin. I remember him. He was calm. Calmer than any of us. He asked me if the facility had good food.

*Sienna's face does something complicated.*

**SIENNA**: Subject -- Pel survived conversion. His Resonance yield was above average. He's... the records indicate he was transferred to a secondary facility. I don't know which one. I've been trying to track the transfers since I left, but the Initiative moved subjects between sites regularly. To prevent exactly this.

**IRIS**: To prevent someone from finding them.

**SIENNA**: Yes.

*Iris looks at Sienna. Sienna looks at the notebook. The distance between them is two feet and twelve years of compounding guilt.*

**IRIS**: You have a list. Do you have a plan?

**SIENNA**: I have the beginning of one. The extraction protocol from Station Theta -- it's theoretical. Unfinished. But I've been refining it. In the margins. At night. Between patients.

*She pulls a second notebook from the desk drawer. This one is thicker, stuffed with loose pages, equations bleeding off the margins, diagrams of crystal lattice structures.*

**SIENNA**: A reversal protocol. The process that converts a person into a Resonance battery is, in principle, thermodynamically reversible. The crystal matrix preserves the original consciousness -- that's what makes it effective as a power source. If I can destabilize the matrix in a controlled sequence while supporting the biological substrate, it should be possible to extract the person intact.

**IRIS**: "Should be possible."

**SIENNA**: The probability of success in a first attempt is -- *she catches herself doing the statistics thing* -- low. The protocol has never been tested on a living subject.

**IRIS**: And what happens when it fails?

**SIENNA**: The subject dies. Immediately. The crystal matrix collapses and the consciousness... scatters.

*Silence.*

**KAEL**: How many of the fifty-three are still alive?

**SIENNA**: I don't know. Some were disposed of when their output dropped below operational thresholds. Some were transferred to facilities I can't locate. Based on the records I was able to copy before Station Theta collapsed, at least nineteen are still in stasis at various Initiative sites. Alive. Conscious. Waiting.

*She looks at Kael. Then at Iris. Her hands are shaking badly enough that the pen she's still holding taps against the desk.*

**SIENNA**: I need to find them.

### Gameplay Note

> Quest log updated: "The Book of Names -- Stage 1: The Ledger." Sienna's notebook is now a key item. It tracks the fifty-three subjects by name and includes any status information the player discovers. The next stage triggers when the party reaches a location with Initiative intelligence (Gearhaven, Initiative outpost, or via Cipher's network access). Cipher can cross-reference the notebook names against Initiative transfer records to locate surviving subjects.

> Bond impact: Kael+Sienna +2. Iris+Sienna +1 (the trust is grudging but real). All party members gain awareness of the quest -- camp dialogue updates.

## Scene 2: Subject 14

**Location**: An unnamed settlement on the Ironcoast-Cindral border -- a mining town called Greywell
**Party**: Sienna, Kael, Iris (required); one optional slot
**Time**: Overcast afternoon. Drizzle. The kind of gray that gets into your bones.
**Gameplay Context**: Mid-to-late Act II. Cipher's data analysis locates a former Initiative holding site near Greywell. The site was officially decommissioned two years ago, but Resonance readings suggest active crystal signatures. The party travels there expecting an abandoned facility. They find something worse.
**Estimated Duration**: 15 minutes

### Setting

Greywell is a town that exists because of a mine and will die when the mine runs out. Low stone buildings. Muddy streets. A single tavern with a sign that reads "The Deep Shaft" in letters that were painted by someone who had given up on aesthetics around the second letter. The people here work the crystal seams -- low-grade Resonance ore, barely worth the extraction, but it keeps food on tables.

At the edge of town, past the tailings piles: a house. Stone walls, heavy door, curtains drawn. The crystal signature is coming from inside. The neighbors avoid looking at it. When Sienna asks about it, the barkeep says: "That's the glowing man's house. He pays rent. He doesn't cause trouble. We don't ask questions."

### The Glowing Man

*Sienna knocks on the door. No answer. She knocks again.*

*The door opens. A woman. Forty, maybe. Hard hands. Miner's build. She blocks the doorway.*

**WOMAN**: We're not buying anything.

**SIENNA**: I'm not selling anything. My name is Dr. Sienna Vex. I'm looking for someone who may have been brought here from an Initiative facility two years ago.

*The woman's face changes. Fear, then anger, then something that calcifies into defiance.*

**WOMAN**: You're Initiative.

**SIENNA**: I was.

**WOMAN**: Get off my porch.

**SIENNA**: Please. The person I'm looking for -- his name is Marcus Theel. He was a teacher. He was thirty-four when he was taken. He would be thirty-eight now.

*The woman doesn't move. Her hand is on the door. Behind her, deeper in the house, there's light. Not lamplight. Something blue-white. Steady. Pulsing.*

**WOMAN**: His name is Marcus. That part's right. The rest of it -- he's not thirty-eight. He's not any age. He's not anything you'd call a person anymore.

*She looks at Sienna with an expression that Sienna will remember for the rest of her life.*

**WOMAN**: Come in. See what you made.

### Inside

*The house is two rooms. The front room is ordinary -- table, chairs, a cold stove. A half-eaten bowl of something on the table. One chair. One bowl. The woman lives alone, except for the light coming from the back room.*

*The back room.*

*Marcus Theel sits in a chair that's been reinforced with iron bracing. He's upright. His eyes are open. His chest rises and falls. But his skin -- from the neck down -- is crystal. Not the smooth crystal of the conversion chambers. Rough. Organic. It's grown into him and he's grown into it, a merger that looks like someone poured glass into a person and the glass decided to stay.*

*His face is still human. Mostly. The crystal creeps up his jaw on the left side. His eyes track movement. His mouth opens and closes, forming words that don't have sound.*

*Crystal conduits -- makeshift, amateur, not Initiative-quality -- run from his chair to a power cell on the floor. Someone has been siphoning his Resonance output. Not much. Enough to power the house lights.*

*The woman stands in the doorway behind the party.*

**WOMAN**: My name is Calloway. Marcus is my brother. The Initiative dumped him on my doorstep two years ago when they decommissioned the site. A truck, middle of the night, two soldiers. They carried him in, set up the conduits, and left. They said he was "decommissioned but unrecoverable." They said the conduits would keep him stable. They said not to talk about it.

*Sienna is standing three feet from Marcus. She hasn't moved since she entered the room. Her hands aren't shaking. They've gone completely still -- the way they do when the tremor overloads and the nervous system gives up.*

**CALLOWAY**: I feed him. He can swallow, if you put food in his mouth. He can blink. He can move his eyes. Some days I think he recognizes me. Some days he stares at the wall for twelve hours. The crystal grows a little every month. The doctors in town won't touch him. They don't know what he is.

*She looks at Sienna.*

**CALLOWAY**: But you do. Don't you.

**SIENNA**: I... yes. I know what he is. I know what he is because I'm the person who did this to him.

*The room goes cold.*

**CALLOWAY**: Say that again.

**SIENNA**: My name is Dr. Sienna Vex. I designed the Resonance battery conversion protocol. I personally oversaw Marcus's conversion on the fourteenth day of Iron, 291 PS. He was my fourteenth subject. He told me about his students. He said he was worried they'd fall behind while he was gone.

*Sienna reaches into her coat. Pulls out the notebook. Opens it to Marcus's entry.*

**SIENNA**: Subject 14. Marcus Theel. Age 34. Elementary school teacher. Notes: "cooperative, expressed concern for his class." I wrote that. Cooperative. As if his compliance while I destroyed his life was a data point worth recording.

*Calloway takes a step toward Sienna. Iris puts herself between them. Not to protect Sienna. To prevent something irreversible.*

**IRIS**: Easy.

**CALLOWAY**: She-- you-- *her voice breaks apart and reforms, harder* --you're the one. The scientist. The one who takes people and--

**SIENNA**: Yes.

**CALLOWAY**: And you came here. You walked into my house and you looked at my brother and you--

**SIENNA**: I came here because I'm trying to undo it.

### The Offer

*Calloway's fists are at her sides. She's crying. Not the performative kind -- the kind where your face screws up and the tears come out angry.*

**CALLOWAY**: Undo it. Undo it. You can't undo this. Look at him. Look at what he is. You can't undo crystal. You can't undo six years of sitting in a chair while your body turns into a lamp.

**SIENNA**: You're right. I can't undo the six years. I can't undo the fear, or the loneliness, or the -- *she stops. Starts over, smaller.* I can't undo what I did to him. But I believe I can reverse the crystallization. Extract him from the matrix. Give him his body back.

**CALLOWAY**: You believe.

**SIENNA**: The protocol is untested. The theory is sound. The probability of--

**IRIS**: Sienna. Not now. Not the numbers.

*Sienna closes her mouth. Opens it again.*

**SIENNA**: It might work. It might kill him. I don't know which.

*Calloway looks at Marcus. He's staring at Sienna. His mouth is moving. The same shape, over and over. Calloway has learned to read his lips over two years.*

**CALLOWAY**: He's saying your name. Doctor Vex. Over and over. He remembers you.

*Something behind Sienna's glasses shatters.*

*She takes her glasses off. Folds them. Puts them in her pocket. Her bare face is older than it should be -- the lines around her eyes, the gray at her temples, the exhaustion that has nothing to do with sleep.*

**SIENNA**: *(to Marcus, directly, quietly)* I know you can hear me. I know you've been hearing everything for six years. I designed the protocol to maintain consciousness because I thought -- because the data suggested higher Resonance yield from conscious subjects. I made a choice to keep you aware. I need you to know that I know what that choice cost you.

*Marcus's eyes focus. For the first time, clearly. On Sienna. His crystal-encrusted hand twitches. His mouth forms different words. Calloway watches.*

**CALLOWAY**: He says... "fix it."

*Sienna puts her glasses back on.*

**SIENNA**: I'll try.

### Gameplay Note

> Quest updated: "The Book of Names -- Stage 2: Subject 14." Marcus Theel is added to the subject tracker. The party can continue searching for other subjects or proceed to develop the reversal protocol. Sienna requests access to a proper laboratory -- the Gearhaven Undercity resistance safehouse has one, or the party can find an abandoned Initiative lab. Time passes between quest stages (represented by camp scenes where Sienna works late, tests calculations, fills margins with equations).

> Camp scene unlocked: "The Numbers" -- Sienna and Cipher argue about her reversal protocol's probability of success. Cipher finds a mathematical error in her crystallization decay model. Sienna is furious. Then grateful. Then furious again that she's grateful.

## Scene 3: The Reversal Protocol

**Location**: Abandoned Initiative research annex, Ironcoast outskirts -- a bunker converted to a holding facility
**Party**: Sienna, Kael, Iris, Cipher (required); one optional slot
**Time**: Night. Rain on metal. The facility hums with residual Resonance. Emergency lighting casts everything in sick amber.
**Gameplay Context**: Late Act II or early Act III. Intelligence (from Cipher's network access or a side quest lead) reveals a secondary holding site still active. Not officially -- the Initiative has forgotten about it, or is pretending to. Six subjects remain in stasis. The facility's automated systems keep them alive, but the power supply is failing. The subjects have weeks, maybe days.
**Estimated Duration**: 20 minutes

### Setting

The annex is underground. Concrete and steel, Initiative standard, but old -- pre-Vex administration. The corridors smell like recycled air and ozone. Emergency lights blink in half the hallways. The other half are dark.

The holding chamber is at the bottom level. Six crystal pods line the walls -- smaller than Station Theta's cells, more compact, more brutal. Each pod contains a person. The crystal integration varies: some are nearly complete, the human form barely visible inside the matrix. Others are earlier-stage, faces still clear, eyes still moving.

One pod is dark. Its occupant stopped generating Resonance three weeks ago. The automated systems haven't removed the body.

### The Facility

*The party descends through the facility. Cipher disables security -- automated drones running on degraded programming, more dangerous for being glitchy.*

**CIPHER**: The Initiative's filing system lists this as "Annex 7-Beta." Status: decommissioned. Which is obviously a lie, because--

*They gesture at the active power grid, the functioning life support, the six pods glowing in the dark.*

**CIPHER**: --somebody's paying the electric bill.

**IRIS**: Automated maintenance. The Initiative sets up self-sustaining systems for long-term storage. Subjects generate enough Resonance to power their own containment. It's a closed loop.

**CIPHER**: That's efficient.

**IRIS**: That's the word I'd use. If I wanted to throw up.

*Sienna is already at the first pod. Her scanner is out. She's reading crystal matrix density, Resonance output, biological vital signs. The clinical mode is on. All business. Her hands are steady.*

**SIENNA**: Six subjects. Five active, one deceased. Crystal integration ranges from fifty-two percent to -- *she stops at the most crystallized pod, reads the number, continues without inflection* -- ninety-one percent. The deceased subject reached total integration. Consciousness collapse.

**KAEL**: That means...

**SIENNA**: Their mind dissolved into the crystal. They stopped being a person and became a rock. It's the terminal stage of battery conversion. It takes approximately six to eight years, depending on initial Resonance sensitivity and -- *she stops herself* -- it's what happens when nobody reverses the process.

*She moves to the next pod. Reads numbers. Makes notes. Her handwriting is steady. Everything is steady. It shouldn't be.*

### The Decision

*Sienna finishes her assessment. She stands in the center of the chamber, surrounded by pods, lit blue-white from all sides.*

**SIENNA**: Five subjects. I've cross-referenced with the notebook. *She opens it.* Rina Vosh, subject two, age twenty-eight now. Crystal integration: sixty-seven percent. Pel Dorin -- *she glances at Iris* -- subject nine, age forty-one. Integration: fifty-eight percent. Yenara Cross, subject twenty-three, age thirty-three. Integration: fifty-two percent. Tomás Gren, subject thirty-one, age twenty-three. Integration: seventy-four percent. And Asha Deel, subject forty-seven, age twenty-nine. Integration: eighty-three percent.

*She closes the notebook.*

**SIENNA**: I can attempt the reversal protocol. I have the equipment, the theory, and the time -- the facility's power will sustain for approximately seventy-two hours before the backup generator fails. After that, the pods lose containment and the subjects die regardless.

**CIPHER**: What are the odds?

**SIENNA**: I don't want to--

**IRIS**: Say it.

*Sienna adjusts her glasses. Puts them back exactly where they were.*

**SIENNA**: The subjects with lower integration -- fifty to sixty percent -- have a reasonable chance. Sixty to seventy percent -- the probability drops. Seventy to eighty percent... I don't know. I genuinely don't know. The model breaks down at those levels because I never -- because the protocol was never designed for subjects that far into conversion. And above eighty percent...

**KAEL**: Asha.

**SIENNA**: Asha Deel is at eighty-three percent integration. If I attempt reversal, the crystal matrix collapse would almost certainly -- she would almost certainly die. But if I do nothing, she reaches terminal integration in weeks. She dies anyway. She just dies slower.

*Iris walks the line of pods. Stops at Pel Dorin's. Presses her hand against the glass -- the flesh hand, not the metal one.*

**IRIS**: What are the other options?

**SIENNA**: *(she's thought about this -- she's thought about nothing else)* Three.

### Choice: The Reversal

*Sienna lays it out. She's rehearsed this. The sentences are too clean -- she's said them to herself in the dark, over and over, testing each one for the guilt it carries.*

**SIENNA**: Option one. I attempt the reversal on all five subjects. The lower-integration cases -- Yenara, Pel, Rina -- have the best chances. Tomás is uncertain. Asha... I would be attempting a procedure I know will likely fail, on a person I personally put in that pod.

*She pauses.*

**SIENNA**: Option two. Mercy protocol. I can collapse the crystal matrices painlessly. The consciousness disperses. They stop existing. No more awareness, no more suffering. It's what the Initiative calls "decommissioning." I've seen it done. I've... authorized it.

*Her voice gets quieter.*

**SIENNA**: Option three. I stabilize the existing containment. Repair the power systems. Keep them alive in stasis while I perfect the protocol -- weeks, maybe months of additional research. They remain conscious. Aware. Trapped. But alive. And the chances improve with time.

*She looks at Kael.*

**SIENNA**: I can't make this decision alone. I forfeited the right to make decisions about these people when I made the first one.

**[A] "Try the reversal. All of them. They deserve the chance."**
> Sienna attempts the reversal protocol on all five subjects. The process takes hours per subject -- represented by a montage with interstitial dialogue. Results:
> - **Yenara Cross** (52%): Successful. She wakes up confused, weak, but alive. First words: "Where am I? What year is it?"
> - **Pel Dorin** (58%): Successful. He wakes up and immediately asks for water. Then asks where his tools are. Then sees Iris and says, "You. I remember you. You were kind." Iris has to leave the room.
> - **Rina Vosh** (67%): Successful, but with complications. She wakes up but can't move her left side. Crystal scarring. Permanent. She'll live, but she'll carry what was done to her in her body forever.
> - **Tomas Gren** (74%): The reversal destabilizes. Sienna fights to control the matrix collapse. Tomas wakes up for eleven seconds -- long enough to look at Sienna, say "Oh. You came back." -- and then the crystal shatters. He's gone.
> - **Asha Deel** (83%): The reversal fails immediately. The crystal matrix collapses. Sienna catches the cascade, tries to contain it, can't. Asha's consciousness scatters. The pod goes dark.
>
> Three saved. Two lost. Sienna stands in the chamber with crystal dust on her hands and shaking that won't stop.
>
> *Reward*: "Sienna's Reversal" -- Sienna gains the ability "Resonance Extraction" (remove crystallization debuffs from allies, chance to reverse enemy Resonance shields). Three freed subjects become NPCs in the epilogue. Unique Echo: "Sienna's Redemption" unlocked.
>
> *Consequence*: Sienna is devastated but functional. She has data from the failures. The protocol works. It works imperfectly, and two people died, and she'll carry those names next to the original fifty-three. But it works. This gives the party the tools to free Cage prisoners in Act III.

**[B] "End their suffering. Painlessly. Let them go."**
> Sienna performs the mercy protocol. One by one. She says each name. She explains what she's going to do. She asks permission, even though they can't answer, because the alternative is doing it without asking and she has done enough of that.
>
> It takes twenty minutes. When it's over, five pods are dark.
>
> Sienna sits on the floor. She doesn't cry. She opens the notebook and draws a single line through each name. Not crossing them out. Closing them. A period at the end of a sentence.
>
> *Reward*: Sienna gains the ability "Peaceful Release" (instantly end any crystallization or Hollow status effect on allies or enemies -- heals allies, defeats crystalline enemies outright). No freed subjects. Unique Echo: "Sienna's Mercy" unlocked.
>
> *Consequence*: The reversal protocol remains untested. In Act III, the party cannot free Cage prisoners directly -- they must find an alternative approach (destroying the Cage entirely, which has collateral consequences). Sienna is quieter afterward. Her clinical voice comes back harder, like scar tissue.

**[C] "Stabilize them. Buy time. Perfect the protocol."**
> Sienna and Cipher spend forty-eight hours repairing the facility's power systems and reinforcing the containment pods. The subjects remain in stasis -- alive, conscious, trapped, but stable for months rather than weeks.
>
> Sienna continues working on the protocol between story beats. Camp scenes show her filling notebooks, running calculations, barely sleeping. She tests on crystal samples. On Echo fragments. On her own Resonance-scarred hands.
>
> *Reward*: Delayed resolution. In Act III (Chapter 25, Gallery of Selves), Sienna's trial involves completing the protocol under pressure. If she succeeds, the protocol is perfected -- all five subjects can be freed later (100% success rate). If she fails, the subjects die when the facility's power finally gives out.
>
> *Consequence*: The subjects remain imprisoned for the duration. The moral cost is ongoing -- they are conscious and suffering while Sienna works to perfect a solution. Kael and Iris have opinions about this. Not all of them are supportive. Sienna argues that imperfect action kills people; perfect inaction just delays death. Neither position is comfortable.

### Gameplay Note

> Major branching point. The choice here affects:
> - Available abilities for Sienna
> - Act III Cage confrontation options
> - Epilogue outcomes for Sienna and the subjects
> - Dialogue with Director Vex in Chapter 23
> - The unique Echo received at quest completion
>
> If Choice A: unlocked camp scene "Three and Two" (Sienna processes the results with the party)
> If Choice B: unlocked camp scene "The Last Entry" (Sienna finishes the notebook section)
> If Choice C: unlocked camp scene "The Margin Notes" (Sienna and Cipher argue about the protocol)

## Scene 4: The Reckoning

**Location**: Party camp (location varies based on story progression)
**Party**: Sienna and Iris (required); Kael present but mostly observing
**Time**: Night. Fire. Stars. The kind of quiet that only happens when everyone else is asleep.
**Gameplay Context**: Triggered one chapter after the Scene 3 choice. This is the emotional resolution -- Sienna and Iris, alone with each other, finally saying the things that have been building since Chapter 13. Also: the three-way choice about Sienna's research.
**Estimated Duration**: 15 minutes

### Setting

A camp somewhere on the road. Garrick's fire has burned down to coals. The others are asleep -- Cipher curled under their coat, Nyx floating inches above the ground, Garrick sitting against a boulder with his eyes closed (not actually asleep, but giving the illusion). Ash sleeps near Garrick. Lyra has dimmed to near-invisibility.

Sienna sits apart from the fire, as she always does. Her notebook is open. Her second notebook -- the research one -- is beside it. She's not writing. She's staring at the names.

### Iris

*Iris approaches. She doesn't sit down immediately. She stands, arms crossed, prosthetic hand catching firelight.*

*A long time passes.*

**IRIS**: You don't sleep.

**SIENNA**: I sleep. Intermittently. Three to four hours in fragmented cycles. It's sufficient for baseline cognitive function.

**IRIS**: That's not sleeping, Sienna. That's maintenance.

*Sienna looks up. Iris is silhouetted against the fire. Her face is hard to read.*

**SIENNA**: Did you come over here to discuss my sleep habits?

**IRIS**: No. I came over here because I've been trying to have this conversation for six weeks and I keep finding reasons not to.

*She sits down. Cross-legged. Close enough that Sienna could touch her if she reached out. She doesn't reach out.*

### [If Choice A was made -- The Reversal]

**IRIS**: Tomas Gren. And Asha Deel.

*Sienna's hands go still.*

**SIENNA**: Yes.

**IRIS**: When Tomas woke up. Those eleven seconds. He said "you came back."

**SIENNA**: I heard him.

**IRIS**: He wasn't angry. He'd been sitting in a crystal coffin for six years and when he saw the person who put him there, he said "you came back." Like he'd been waiting. Like he always knew you would.

*Sienna takes her glasses off. Cleans them on her coat. Puts them back. They don't need cleaning.*

**SIENNA**: I don't know what to do with that. Clinically, it could indicate cognitive deterioration -- a six-year-old memory loop providing comfort through repetition rather than accurate emotional response--

**IRIS**: Sienna. Stop.

*Sienna stops.*

**IRIS**: He forgave you. In eleven seconds, with his last breath, a man you turned into a power cell forgave you. And you're sitting here trying to explain it away with neuroscience.

**SIENNA**: Because the alternative is accepting that I was forgiven by someone I murdered.

**IRIS**: Yeah. The alternative is that.

*Silence. The coals pop. Somewhere an owl calls -- a real one, not an Echo.*

**IRIS**: When I left the Initiative, I didn't save anyone. I walked past those transport doors and I kept walking. I told myself I'd come back. I'd gather evidence, find allies, bring the whole operation down. I never came back. Not until we walked into Station Theta together.

*She holds up her prosthetic hand. Turns it in the firelight.*

**IRIS**: This arm. Same Resonance channeling technology as the conversion chambers. Same patent. I wear the murder weapon every day. I fight with it. I open jars with it.

*Her laugh is short and ragged.*

**IRIS**: We're not the same, you and me. What you did is worse. I need you to know that I know that. You were the architect. I was the truck driver. There's a difference.

**SIENNA**: There is.

**IRIS**: But the guilt -- *she taps the prosthetic against her knee, a hollow sound* -- the guilt is the same shape. I know what it feels like to lie awake and do the arithmetic. How many people. How many years. How many chances to stop that I didn't take. And I know that the arithmetic never finishes, because you can always find another thing you should have done.

*She turns to face Sienna directly.*

**IRIS**: You saved three people. You tried to save five. Two of them died. And you're going to carry those two with the other fifty-three, and the number is going to be fifty-five in your head forever, and the three you saved won't subtract from it because guilt doesn't work like math. I know this because my number is twelve and it has never gone down.

**SIENNA**: *(very quietly)* Iris.

**IRIS**: I'm not forgiving you. I'm not there yet. I don't know if I'll get there. But I'm telling you that I see you. Sitting here with your two notebooks and your shaking hands, trying to turn a list of atrocities into a ledger that balances. I see that. And it's the most human thing I've watched anyone do.

### [If Choice B was made -- The Mercy]

**IRIS**: Five names.

**SIENNA**: Yes.

**IRIS**: You said them out loud. Each one. Before you--

**SIENNA**: Before I killed them. Yes. I said their names. It seemed like the minimum. The absolute, pathetic, insulting minimum.

**IRIS**: It was more than the Initiative gave them.

**SIENNA**: That is an extraordinarily low bar.

*Silence. Iris picks up a stick. Pokes the coals.*

**IRIS**: Pel Dorin. When you -- when you performed the protocol. What was his face like?

**SIENNA**: *(long pause)* Still. His face was still. The crystal matrix collapsed in approximately four seconds. There may have been a moment of awareness -- the data suggests a brief spike in cognitive function immediately before dissolution. He may have known. Or he may have simply stopped.

**IRIS**: Was he scared?

**SIENNA**: I don't know.

**IRIS**: *(quietly)* When I transported him, he was calm. Calmer than any of us. He asked if the facility had good food. I told him it did. I lied. The food was terrible. It was the kind of lie you tell because the truth is too big and a small kindness is all you've got.

*She drops the stick into the coals.*

**IRIS**: I'm glad you said his name. I'm glad someone was there at the end who knew what it cost.

**SIENNA**: That's not -- I'm not -- *her clinical distance collapses* -- I killed five people today, Iris. People I put there. People I could have saved if I'd finished the protocol, if I'd had more time, if I'd started sooner, if I'd defected five years ago instead of five months ago--

**IRIS**: Stop.

**SIENNA**: I can't. The variables keep--

**IRIS**: Sienna. Stop. Listen.

*Iris reaches out. Her hand -- the prosthetic one, cold metal, Initiative-built -- covers Sienna's. The shaking hand and the metal hand. Sienna stares at the contact like it's a physical impossibility.*

**IRIS**: You are never going to solve this with math. The equation doesn't balance. Five dead, fifty-three damaged, twelve years of looking away -- there's no number on the other side that makes it come out even. There is no amount of good work that subtracts from the bad. It doesn't work like that.

**SIENNA**: Then what does it work like?

**IRIS**: I don't know. I'm still figuring it out. But I think it starts with someone sitting next to you in the dark and telling you that the math doesn't matter, and meaning it.

### [If Choice C was made -- The Stabilization]

**IRIS**: They're still in there.

**SIENNA**: Yes.

**IRIS**: Conscious.

**SIENNA**: Yes.

**IRIS**: And you're sitting here doing math.

**SIENNA**: I'm refining the crystallization decay model. Cipher identified a phase-transition coefficient that I'd misestimated by a factor of--

**IRIS**: Five people are awake in crystal coffins RIGHT NOW, and you're refining a coefficient.

*Sienna puts the pen down. Her jaw sets.*

**SIENNA**: What would you have me do, Iris? Attempt the reversal with an imperfect protocol and watch them die? Because that IS the alternative. I run the numbers and three of them survive. Maybe four. Maybe two. I don't know, because the model is INCOMPLETE, and the reason I'm sitting here at two in the morning refining a coefficient is because the difference between the wrong coefficient and the right one is the difference between Pel Dorin waking up and Pel Dorin dying on the table.

**IRIS**: And while you perfect your numbers, he's lying there. Awake. Alone. Knowing.

**SIENNA**: I KNOW.

*Her voice breaks the night open. Garrick stirs against his boulder. Sienna catches herself. When she speaks again, it's barely above a whisper.*

**SIENNA**: I know they're awake. I know they're suffering. I designed the protocol to maintain consciousness. I built the cage and I locked them in it and now I'm sitting here trying to build the key and the key won't FIT because I was too good at building cages. Do you think I don't know? Do you think I don't hear them? I hear Marcus Theel saying my name every time I close my eyes. I hear Tomas Gren telling me a joke about an airship. I hear--

*She stops. Her breathing is ragged. Her glasses are fogging.*

**IRIS**: Okay.

**SIENNA**: Don't "okay" me.

**IRIS**: Okay anyway. Here. *(She sits closer.)* Show me the coefficient. I'm an engineer. I can check your work.

*Sienna stares at her.*

**IRIS**: What? I spent six years building Resonance channeling systems. The crystal matrix physics aren't that different from prosthetic nerve integration. Show me what you've got.

*Slowly, Sienna opens the notebook. Points to the problem. Iris leans in. Their heads are close together -- the scientist and the engineer, working on the same impossible equation.*

**IRIS**: This variable here. You're modeling the crystal lattice as uniform density. It's not. The biological substrate creates localized stress points. You need a gradient, not a constant.

*Sienna looks at the equation. At Iris. At the equation.*

**SIENNA**: That's... correct. That would improve the decay prediction by...

**IRIS**: Don't do the math out loud. Just fix it. And then sleep. You're no good to them dead on your feet.

### The Choice About the Research

*Regardless of the prior choice, the conversation arrives here. Sienna's notebooks are open between them.*

**SIENNA**: There's something I need to decide. And I need someone to hear the decision out loud, because I don't trust myself to make it in the dark.

*She picks up the research notebook. The reversal protocol. Every equation, every theory, every simulation, every piece of data she pulled from Station Theta and every sleepless night since.*

**SIENNA**: This notebook contains the complete Resonance battery conversion AND reversal protocols. Everything. How to turn a person into a power cell. How to -- possibly -- turn them back. If my brother got his hands on this, he could build a hundred Cages. If the Free Resonants got it, they could free every subject the Initiative has ever taken. If the Shepherds got it, they'd burn it and everyone who'd read it.

*She holds the notebook out.*

**SIENNA**: What do I do with this?

### Choice: The Research

**[A] "Destroy it. All of it. No one should have this power."**
> Sienna tears out the pages. One by one. Feeds them to the fire. The equations curl and blacken. Twelve years of research. The key to the Cage AND the key to undoing it, consumed in the same flame.
>
> She watches until the last page is ash. Then she closes the empty notebook.
>
> **SIENNA**: When I was a student, my professor told me that the mark of a great scientist is knowing when to publish and when to burn. I thought she was being dramatic.
>
> *She puts the empty notebook in her coat.*
>
> **SIENNA**: She wasn't.
>
> *Consequence*: Sienna loses access to some combat abilities (no "Resonance Extraction" or "Peaceful Release"). She gains "Clean Slate" -- a unique passive that increases all party members' resistance to crystallization effects. In Act III, the party cannot use the protocol to free Cage prisoners directly -- they must destroy the Cage itself (higher stakes, more collateral risk). Sienna's confrontation with Vex is fiercer: she's destroyed the thing he wanted most, and she did it willingly.

**[B] "Publish it. Give it to the Free Resonants. Let everyone see what the Initiative did."**
> Sienna copies the notebook. Cipher helps encrypt and distribute it through the underground network. Within weeks, the Free Resonants have it. Within months, independent scientists are replicating the reversal protocol in clinics across Aethermoor.
>
> The conversion protocol is also public. Anyone can build a battery now. The knowledge is free, and freedom is dangerous.
>
> **SIENNA**: My brother will see this. He'll know it was me.
>
> **IRIS**: Good.
>
> **SIENNA**: The conversion protocol is in there too. Other people could--
>
> **IRIS**: They could. But they could also use the reversal. You're giving people the disease AND the cure. That's not ideal. But it's honest.
>
> **SIENNA**: Honesty is a luxury that frequently gets people killed.
>
> **IRIS**: So does secrecy.
>
> *Consequence*: Sienna keeps all abilities. The published research creates ripple effects -- in Act III, some Initiative scientists defect after reading it. Others weaponize it. The world gets messier, but also more capable of fighting back. In the epilogue, Sienna's research saves thousands -- and is misused by dozens. She has to live with both.

**[C] "Keep working. In secret. Until it's ready."**
> Sienna keeps the notebook. Continues refining the protocol privately. She's not ready to share it -- not because she's selfish, but because the reversal protocol at its current state kills two out of five subjects. She won't publish a tool that kills forty percent of the people it's supposed to save.
>
> **SIENNA**: I know what you're going to say. That secrecy is how this started. That keeping knowledge locked away is what the Initiative does. And you're right. But publishing an incomplete protocol is -- it's the same thing I did before. Giving people a tool I know is dangerous and telling myself it's their problem now.
>
> **IRIS**: There's a difference between "incomplete" and "dangerous."
>
> **SIENNA**: Not when the consequence of incompleteness is death.
>
> *Consequence*: Sienna's abilities improve over the remaining chapters as she refines the protocol (new ability unlocks in Act III). The secrecy creates tension -- Cipher especially objects to keeping life-saving research private. In the epilogue, the protocol is eventually perfected and published. The delay costs some lives. The accuracy saves others. Sienna carries the math of that trade-off forever.

## Epilogue

*Regardless of choices, the quest ends with a final scene -- triggered after the main quest resolution but before the ending epilogue.*

### The Last Page

**Location**: Varies by ending
**Party**: Sienna, alone
**Time**: Morning
**Estimated Duration**: 3 minutes

*Sienna opens the leather notebook. The first section -- the fifty-three names -- is unchanged. Every name. Every age. Every occupation.*

*She turns to the back of the book. The pages of people she's treated since leaving the Initiative. The number is over two hundred now.*

### [If Choice A in Scene 3 -- Reversal Attempted]

*She turns to a new page. Writes three names.*

*Yenara Cross. Pel Dorin. Rina Vosh.*

*Under each name, she writes: "Freed."*

*She turns the page. Writes two more names. Tomas Gren. Asha Deel.*

*Under each: "Lost."*

*She stares at the page for a long time. Then she writes, at the bottom, in handwriting steadier than it's been in years:*

*"These five do not balance the fifty-three. Nothing balances the fifty-three. But the ledger is not for balancing. It is for remembering. I will remember all of them. Every name. Every face. Every joke a seventeen-year-old told me while I was strapping him to a table. I will remember, and I will continue. That is not redemption. It is responsibility. It is enough. It has to be enough."*

*She closes the notebook. Puts it in her coat pocket. Goes to find the others.*

*There is work to do.*

### [If Choice B in Scene 3 -- Mercy Protocol]

*She turns to the last page with names. Draws five lines -- not crossing out, closing. Five periods at the end of five sentences.*

*Below the lines, she writes:*

*"I am learning that mercy is not the same thing as giving up. I am learning that ending suffering is not the same as failing to prevent it. I am learning slowly. The data is inconclusive. The sample size is one. But I think -- I think that kindness and precision are not opposites. I think you can be exact about compassion. I think Dr. Lyra Reyes knew this three hundred years ago when she made her choice, and I am only now beginning to understand it."*

*She touches the closed notebook to her forehead. A gesture that's not scientific. Not clinical. Something older than that.*

*She puts it away. Walks toward the morning.*

### [If Choice C in Scene 3 -- Stabilization]

*She opens the research notebook. The final equation -- the perfected reversal protocol, completed during her trial in the Gallery of Selves -- fills the last page.*

*She copies it into the back of the leather notebook. Under the patient names. Under the subject names. A formula written in the same handwriting as the fifty-three, but different. The hand that wrote the fifty-three names was steady with professional detachment. The hand that writes the formula shakes. The shaking makes the letters human.*

*She writes beneath the formula:*

*"For Marcus. For Rina. For Pel. For Yenara. For Tomas. For Asha. For the forty-seven I cannot name in this margin. The key fits. It took too long. It always takes too long. The only answer to 'too long' is 'but now.' Now."*

*She closes both notebooks. Stacks them. Holds them against her chest with both trembling hands.*

*She goes to find Cipher. There are pods to open.*
