# Camp Bonding Conversations

Optional camp scenes that trigger based on bond levels and story progress. These are the quiet moments between crises -- the mundane sacred. Each scene does double duty: character + worldbuilding, or humor + foreshadowing.

**Note**: Camp scenes already written in chapter files (Ch11 "What Nobody Asked," Ch12 "Operating Systems," Ch16 recovery scenes, Ch17 Hollows camp, Ch19 "Camp at the Core's Edge," Ch20 "The Last Night Before") are NOT duplicated here.

## Act I Bonding Scenes

### BOND-01: Knife Lessons

**Trigger**: After Chapter 3, bond level Kael+Iris >= 1
**Location**: Any camp, Verdant Tangle
**Party**: Kael, Iris
**Time**: Evening, firelight
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Small fire. Iris is field-stripping her prosthetic's wrist actuator. Kael is badly carving a wooden Echo marker.

### The Conversation

*Kael's knife slips. They hiss, shake their hand.*

**IRIS**: You're holding it wrong.

**KAEL**: I've been carving these since I was twelve.

**IRIS**: And you've been holding it wrong since you were twelve. Here.

*She sets the actuator down, takes the knife. Demonstrates a grip -- thumb on the spine, index curled, blade angled away from the body.*

**IRIS**: Military wood-carving. For field stakes, traps, that kind of thing. The angle means you never cut toward your palm.

**KAEL**: Military wood-carving is a thing?

**IRIS**: Everything is a thing in the Initiative. There's a regulation for how to sneeze. Section twelve, paragraph nine. I'm not joking.

*Kael tries the grip. Slices a clean curl off the wood.*

**KAEL**: Huh. That's actually better.

**IRIS**: Don't sound so surprised.

*Beat. Kael carves. Iris watches, then goes back to her actuator.*

**KAEL**: What's section twelve, paragraph ten?

**IRIS**: Coughing.

**KAEL**: You are joking.

**IRIS**: I'm not. "Coughing in formation: cover mouth with non-dominant hand, angle face forty-five degrees from nearest superior officer." Direct quote.

*Kael laughs. Iris almost does. She catches herself, looks away, and her mouth settles into something that could be a smile if you squinted.*

**IRIS**: ...The knife thing is real, though. Keep using that grip.

### BOND-02: Memory Bloom

**Trigger**: After Chapter 4, bond level Kael+Garrick >= 1
**Location**: Any camp, Verdant Tangle
**Party**: Kael, Garrick
**Time**: Late evening, embers low
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Garrick is sitting by the fire, shield propped against a log. He's polishing it -- the scratched-out Shepherd emblem visible in the firelight. A slow, methodical motion he's clearly done ten thousand times.

### The Conversation

*Kael sits across the fire. They watch Garrick for a while.*

**KAEL**: You could sand it off entirely. The emblem.

**GARRICK**: ...

*He keeps polishing.*

**GARRICK**: Could.

**KAEL**: But you won't.

**GARRICK**: Smooth metal's a lie. Scratched metal's a record.

*Long pause. Fire crackles.*

**KAEL**: Back home we've got this thing -- memory bloom. When the memory honey flowers open in the spring and the whole Tangle smells sweet for a week. People get nostalgic. Cry about things they forgot they missed.

**GARRICK**: We've got something like that. In the Wastes.

**KAEL**: Yeah?

**GARRICK**: First rain after the dry season. Ash turns to mud. Mud smells like everything that burned. People go quiet. Not sad. Just... remembering.

*He stops polishing. Holds the shield up. The scratched emblem catches the light -- you can still make out the shape of it. A torch crossed with a crystal.*

**GARRICK**: This is my rain.

*He sets the shield down. Kael doesn't say anything else. They sit together until the fire goes to embers.*

---

### BOND-03: The Star Question

**Trigger**: After Chapter 6, bond level Kael+Nyx >= 1
**Location**: Any camp, night
**Party**: Kael, Nyx
**Time**: Night, clear sky
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Kael is sketching in their journal by firelight. Nyx is lying on their back, staring up. Their starfield eyes mirror the sky in an unsettling way -- as if there's no boundary between the stars inside them and the stars above.

### The Conversation

**NYX**: Kael.

**KAEL**: Mm?

**NYX**: How many of those have names?

*Kael looks up. The sky is thick with stars.*

**KAEL**: The stars? I don't know. Some of them. The bright ones have names from before the Severance. People used to navigate by them.

**NYX**: All the others are unnamed?

**KAEL**: I guess.

**NYX**: That seems wrong. They're doing their job. Shining. Nobody notices because there's a brighter one nearby.

*Kael puts down their journal.*

**KAEL**: ...Are we still talking about stars?

**NYX**: I don't know. Am I allowed to talk about two things at once? I saw Iris do it. She was talking about shield harmonics and also about missing Gearhaven. At the same time. Different mouths.

**KAEL**: She only has one mouth.

**NYX**: The words came from one mouth. The meaning came from another one that wasn't a mouth.

*Kael stares at Nyx. Nyx stares at the sky.*

**KAEL**: Nyx, that might be the most perceptive thing anyone has ever said about Iris.

**NYX**: Is that good?

**KAEL**: That's really good.

**NYX**: Okay.

*Pause.*

**NYX**: I want to name a star. The dim one. There. Left of the bright one that everyone already named.

**KAEL**: What do you want to call it?

**NYX**: Bread.

**KAEL**: ...Bread?

**NYX**: It's my favorite thing. After butterflies. And before rain. Bread is third. That star is now Bread.

*Kael writes "Bread" in their journal, next to a small sketch of the constellation. Nyx watches them do it, and their starfield eyes brighten -- just a little.*

---

### BOND-04: The Prosthetic Argument

**Trigger**: After Chapter 5, Iris and Garrick both in party, bond >= 1
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Iris, Garrick (Kael can listen)
**Time**: Morning, packing up camp
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Iris is performing morning maintenance on her prosthetic arm. Garrick is cleaning his armor straps. They haven't spoken directly in two days.

### The Conversation

*Iris flexes the prosthetic. Something catches -- a grinding sound. She winces.*

**GARRICK**: Sand in the joint.

**IRIS**: I know.

**GARRICK**: Compressed air. If you've got it.

**IRIS**: I have a repair protocol, thanks. I don't need—

**GARRICK**: I maintained siege equipment for thirty years. Resonance-powered articulating rams. Your arm's finer work, but the principle's the same. Sand gets in, you clear it before it grinds the sleeve.

*Iris stares at him.*

**IRIS**: You maintained siege equipment.

**GARRICK**: Shepherds didn't just burn things. We built things too. Had to, in the Wastes. Everything breaks.

**IRIS**: Resonance-powered articulating rams.

**GARRICK**: ...Yes.

**IRIS**: That's basically a giant version of my elbow actuator.

**GARRICK**: Basically.

*Long pause. Iris looks at her arm. Looks at Garrick. She holds out a small compressed air canister.*

**IRIS**: Fine. Show me the maintenance pattern you used. If it's different from mine, I want to see it.

*Garrick takes the canister. His hands -- massive, scarred, built for shields and hammers -- work the tiny mechanism with surprising precision. He clears the sand in three short bursts.*

**GARRICK**: There.

*Iris flexes. Smooth. No grinding.*

**IRIS**: ...That's a better angle than I was using.

**GARRICK**: Comes from the siege equipment.

**IRIS**: Stop saying siege equipment.

**GARRICK**: Siege equipment.

*The faintest trace of a smirk. Iris turns away so he won't see that she almost laughed.*

### BOND-05: Lyra's Lullaby

**Trigger**: After Chapter 8 (Prismfall), Lyra solidity >= 2 fragments
**Location**: Camp near Prismfall
**Party**: Lyra, Kael (anyone else sleeping nearby)
**Time**: Deep night, everyone else asleep
**Estimated Duration**: 3 minutes

### Setting

Most of the party is asleep. Lyra hovers near the edge of the firelight, her translucent form catching the orange glow. She's humming. Very quietly. A melody that sounds like it should have words but doesn't.

### The Conversation

*Kael stirs. Opens one eye.*

**KAEL**: Lyra?

*The humming stops.*

**LYRA**: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

**KAEL**: You didn't. I can never sleep the first night after a dungeon. Too much... residual Echo noise in my head.

*They sit up. Lyra drifts closer.*

**KAEL**: What was that? The melody.

**LYRA**: I... I'm not sure. Before the Severance, there was a piece of music that everyone knew. You'd hear it in restaurants, in transit stations, hummed by strangers on the street. A composer wrote it using Resonance harmonics -- it was designed to feel like coming home. I think I remember the first few bars.

**KAEL**: You think?

**LYRA**: Memory is odd when you're fragmented. I remember the feeling of the song perfectly. The notes... those come and go. Like trying to hold water.

*She hums again. Three notes. Clear, ascending, with a harmonic undertone that makes Kael's Echo-sense tingle.*

**KAEL**: That's... actually beautiful.

**LYRA**: The original was three minutes long. That's all I have left. Three notes out of hundreds.

*Pause.*

**LYRA**: There's a Resonance theory about memory and music. Melodies survive fragmentation better than facts. Because music isn't stored as data -- it's stored as feeling. The Convergence might remember every song ever written, but not a single birthday.

**KAEL**: That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

**LYRA**: Or the most hopeful. Depends on what you think matters more -- dates or feelings.

*Nyx stirs in their sleep. Their starfield eyes flicker -- dreaming, or whatever Nyx does instead of dreaming. Lyra watches them.*

**LYRA**: Sometimes I think Nyx understands more about what we lost than any of us. They experience everything as feeling. No dates. No facts. Just... the shape of things.

*She hums the three notes again. Kael lies back down, and the notes follow them into something that isn't quite sleep and isn't quite waking -- a space between, where three hundred years sounds like three bars of music you almost recognize.*

### BOND-06: Nyx Learns to Cook

**Trigger**: After Chapter 6, Garrick and Nyx both in party
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Garrick, Nyx
**Time**: Evening, Garrick making stew
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Garrick is cooking. Nyx is watching with the intensity of someone observing surgery.

### The Conversation

*Garrick chops root vegetables. Nyx hovers close enough that their shadow-hair occasionally drifts through the cutting board.*

**GARRICK**: You're in my light.

**NYX**: What is light?

**GARRICK**: ...The thing you're standing in front of.

*Nyx shifts. Garrick keeps chopping.*

**NYX**: Why do you do this?

**GARRICK**: Cook?

**NYX**: Cut things into smaller things and put them in water and wait. You could eat the things whole. Iris said the body doesn't care. Nutrients are nutrients.

**GARRICK**: Iris is wrong.

*Nyx's eyes brighten. This is apparently groundbreaking information.*

**NYX**: Iris is *wrong*?

**GARRICK**: About this. Yes. Cooking isn't about nutrients. It's about—

*He pauses. Stirs the pot. Looks for words.*

**GARRICK**: In the Wastes, when you've been walking for days through ash, and everything is gray, and you're tired in a way sleep doesn't fix... someone makes a fire. Boils water. Adds whatever we have. The smell changes everything. Suddenly there's a center to the world. A place to sit. A reason to stop walking.

*He tastes the stew. Adds a pinch of something.*

**GARRICK**: Nutrients are nutrients. Stew is home.

*Nyx processes this. Their form flickers.*

**NYX**: Can I stir?

**GARRICK**: ...Can you hold a spoon?

*Nyx extends a hand. It's more solid than usual -- they're concentrating hard. Garrick places the wooden spoon in their grip. It phases through twice before they get it.*

**NYX**: I have the spoon.

**GARRICK**: Slow circles. Don't scrape the bottom.

*Nyx stirs. The stew doesn't splash, doesn't slosh. It moves in a perfect, geometric spiral. Garrick watches.*

**GARRICK**: That's... not how anyone has ever stirred stew.

**NYX**: Is it wrong?

**GARRICK**: No. It's just very precise.

**NYX**: Iris would approve.

**GARRICK**: She would. And she'd still be wrong about the nutrients.

## Act II Bonding Scenes

### BOND-07: Cipher's Exit Count

**Trigger**: After Chapter 12, bond level Kael+Cipher >= 1
**Location**: Any camp or safe area
**Party**: Kael, Cipher
**Time**: Late night, Cipher on watch
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Cipher sits on a rock, visor down, scanning. Their circuit tattoos pulse faintly -- data flowing. They're always on watch, even when it's not their turn.

### The Conversation

*Kael brings them a mug. Something warm.*

**CIPHER**: Three.

**KAEL**: What?

**CIPHER**: Exits from this campsite. West through the treeline, south along the creek bed, northeast up the ridge. The ridge is exposed but gives line of sight for six hundred meters. The treeline has cover but the footing's bad. Creek bed's the play -- low profile, running water covers sound.

**KAEL**: I was going to say "here's some tea."

**CIPHER**: Oh. Thanks.

*They take the mug. Don't drink. Don't stop scanning.*

**KAEL**: You do that everywhere, don't you? Count exits.

**CIPHER**: Since I was sixteen. First thing I see. Doors, windows, gaps, structural weaknesses. I walk into a room and my brain draws the escape routes before I've even registered the furniture.

**KAEL**: Is it a skill or a compulsion?

**CIPHER**: ...Yes.

*They finally push the visor up. Their eyes are tired. The tattoos dim.*

**CIPHER**: In Gearhaven, the server farm where I lived -- before the Initiative found it -- I could get out thirteen different ways. I tested every one. Monthly. Timed them. Kept records. Redundancies for the redundancies.

**KAEL**: Thirteen seems like a lot.

**CIPHER**: Twelve wasn't enough. The night they came, I used exit nine. Number nine. The sewer junction behind the cooling array. I'd practiced that route so many times I could do it blind. And I did, because they'd cut the power.

*They drink the tea. Small sip.*

**CIPHER**: The thing about counting exits is it means you're always half-leaving. Every room you're in, some part of you is already on the way out.

**KAEL**: Is that true for people too?

*Long pause.*

**CIPHER**: It used to be. I'm... working on it.

*They take another sip. Look at Kael over the mug.*

**CIPHER**: This campsite. Three exits. But I sat down anyway.

### BOND-08: Sienna and Iris (Broken Things)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 13, bond level Iris+Sienna >= 1
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Iris, Sienna (Kael can listen)
**Time**: Morning, early
**Estimated Duration**: 3 minutes

### Setting

Iris is doing arm maintenance. Sienna is writing in her notebook. They're three meters apart and have not spoken in forty minutes.

### The Conversation

*Sienna's hands shake. She puts the pen down. Picks it up. Her handwriting is getting worse -- she can see it. The tremors from chronic Resonance exposure don't stop.*

*Iris watches out of the corner of her eye.*

**IRIS**: Your hands.

**SIENNA**: Are fine.

**IRIS**: They weren't shaking that badly yesterday.

**SIENNA**: Environmental factors. Cold mornings exacerbate the neuropathy. It's a known variable.

**IRIS**: It's getting worse.

*Sienna puts the pen down. Doesn't look up.*

**SIENNA**: Yes. It's getting worse. The tremors correlate with cumulative Resonance exposure. Every time I use the diagnostic equipment, every time I interface with crystal systems, the degradation advances by a small but measurable increment. In approximately—

*She stops herself.*

**SIENNA**: In... some amount of time, I won't be able to hold a pen at all.

*Iris is quiet for a moment. Then she holds up her prosthetic arm. Flexes the fingers.*

**IRIS**: Three years ago, I couldn't hold anything. No arm, no fingers. Just a stump and phantom pain.

**SIENNA**: That's different. That was sudden trauma, not progressive—

**IRIS**: You're right. It's different. I'm not comparing injuries. I'm saying...

*She flexes the prosthetic again.*

**IRIS**: There are solutions. When your hands go, we build new ones. Or we build tools that don't need hands. I'm an engineer. That's what I do. I fix things.

**SIENNA**: You can't fix what Resonance does to neural pathways. I've tried. I wrote three papers on it. The degradation is—

**IRIS**: You wrote papers. I built an arm. Guess which one lets me pick things up.

*Sienna stares at her. Something complicated moves behind her glasses.*

**SIENNA**: You're offering to... help me. Build something.

**IRIS**: I'm offering to help you keep writing. When the time comes. If you want it.

*Long pause.*

**SIENNA**: I don't deserve—

**IRIS**: Didn't ask about deserving. Asked if you want it.

*Sienna picks up her pen. Her hand shakes. She writes a line. Puts the pen down.*

**SIENNA**: ...Yes. I want it.

**IRIS**: Good. Now stop doing that thing where you calculate the exact date your hands stop working. That's not data, that's torture.

**SIENNA**: It's both, actually. But I— yes. I'll try.

### BOND-09: Garrick and Nyx (The Drawing)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 14, bond level Garrick+Nyx >= 2, Ash in party
**Location**: Camp near Emberhearth
**Party**: Garrick, Nyx, Ash nearby
**Time**: Quiet evening
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Garrick is repairing a strap on his armor. Ash is drawing in the dirt with a stick -- abstract shapes that pulse faintly with Resonance. Nyx is watching Ash draw.

### The Conversation

*Nyx drifts over to Garrick. They're holding something -- a scrap of paper, folded small.*

**NYX**: Garrick.

**GARRICK**: Mm.

**NYX**: Ash drew something. They want you to have it.

*Garrick sets down his repair work. Nyx hands him the paper. He unfolds it.*

*It's a drawing. Simple, in charcoal, the way a child draws: a large figure and a small figure sitting by a fire. The fire is drawn in amber and orange, pulsing with faint Resonance warmth that Garrick can feel in his fingertips. The large figure has a shield. The small figure has no face -- just eyes, rendered as two bright points.*

*Garrick doesn't move for a long time.*

**NYX**: Is it wrong? You stopped. Humans stop when things are wrong.

**GARRICK**: ...No.

*His voice is rough. He clears his throat.*

**GARRICK**: Humans also stop when things are right.

*He looks across the camp at Ash. Ash looks back. Their eyes are amber -- warm, steady. They tug at their sleeve, which Garrick has learned means: "I hope you like it but I'm scared you won't."*

*Garrick folds the drawing carefully. Puts it inside his breastplate, against the padded lining where he keeps things that matter.*

**GARRICK**: Tell them it's perfect.

**NYX**: I don't need to tell them. They already know. They felt it when your breathing changed.

*Nyx drifts back to Ash. Garrick sits for a while with one hand over his breastplate, in the spot where two pictures live now: a scratched-out emblem on the outside, and a child's drawing of fire on the inside.*

---

### BOND-10: Cipher and Iris (Gearhaven Kids)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 12, bond level Iris+Cipher >= 1
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Iris, Cipher
**Time**: Night, both awake because neither sleeps well
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Two people from the same city, from different sides of it, finding common ground in the dark.

### The Conversation

*Cipher is fiddling with a small device -- a signal scrambler, homemade. Iris is cleaning her sidearm. The motions are mirror images: disassemble, inspect, reassemble. Repeat.*

**CIPHER**: Did you ever go to Pier Twelve?

**IRIS**: The fish market? Yeah. When I was a kid. My dad used to take me and Dane on weekends.

**CIPHER**: Fish market during the day. At night it was something else. We used to run scams there. Me and a crew of street kids. Crystal-chip skimming. You'd solder a reader into a handshake device, and when the fish sellers shook hands to close a deal—

**IRIS**: You'd skim their transaction data.

**CIPHER**: Small amounts. Never enough to notice. Kept us fed for a year.

**IRIS**: I bought fish from that market. My dad's savings might have funded your criminal career.

**CIPHER**: Your dad's three credits funded my Wednesday lunch. So technically I owe him.

*Iris snorts.*

**IRIS**: God. Gearhaven. You grow up there and you think the whole world is steel and smog and the factory whistle at six AM. Then you leave and find out there are places where people live in *trees*.

**CIPHER**: I didn't believe Kael when they said that. I thought they were being poetic.

**IRIS**: Nope. Actual trees. Hollow ones. With rope bridges.

**CIPHER**: That's profoundly unsafe.

**IRIS**: That's what I said! Iris the engineer. First thing I see is load-bearing capacity.

*They both laugh. Quiet. The kind of laughter that comes from recognizing yourself in someone else.*

**CIPHER**: I miss the food. That's it. Nothing else. Just the street food. Those fried dough things from the Harbor stalls.

**IRIS**: Spar cakes. With the red sauce.

**CIPHER**: The red sauce! Nobody outside Gearhaven knows about the red sauce.

**IRIS**: Because it's made from synthesized peppers that would kill a normal person. Ironcoast stomachs are different.

*Pause. Something warmer between them.*

**CIPHER**: You know, if we survive all this... I want to go back. Just once. Buy a spar cake at Pier Twelve. Eat it on the docks.

**IRIS**: ...I'll go with you. Someone's got to watch the exits.

**CIPHER**: Hey. That's my job.

**IRIS**: Then we'll both watch. Double coverage.

---

### BOND-11: Kael and Sienna (The Mug)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 13, bond level Kael+Sienna >= 1
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Kael, Sienna
**Time**: Early morning, Sienna awake before everyone
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Sienna has a routine. She wakes first. She boils water. She drinks something that approximates coffee. She reviews her notes. She does not talk to anyone until the second cup.

### The Conversation

*Kael wakes up and finds Sienna already on her third page of notes. She's got a battered ceramic mug with "World's Okayest Physicist" written on it in peeling paint.*

**KAEL**: Where did you get that mug?

*Sienna looks down at it like she'd forgotten it existed.*

**SIENNA**: It was a gift. From a colleague. Dr. Maren Koss. She had one that said "World's Best Physicist." Mine was the joke version.

**KAEL**: Was she the best physicist?

**SIENNA**: She was the second best. I was the best. That was also the joke.

*Kael sits down across from her.*

**KAEL**: Where is she now?

*Long pause.*

**SIENNA**: Subject 23.

*Kael doesn't know what to say. Neither does Sienna. She takes a sip from the mug.*

**SIENNA**: She gave me this mug on my thirty-fifth birthday. Seven years ago. Three years later, I... I approved the experiment that—

*Her hands shake. Coffee sloshes.*

**SIENNA**: I approved it. I signed the authorization. Form 17-B, Resonance Integration Trial. "Estimated risk: moderate." I wrote "moderate."

**KAEL**: Sienna—

**SIENNA**: I keep the mug because I should have to look at it. Every morning. That's not— that's not self-punishment, it's accuracy. The mug is data. It says: you had a friend, and you signed a form.

*She puts the mug down with both shaking hands. Breathes.*

**KAEL**: ...It also says "okayest." Which is a word she made up for you. Because she thought you were funny.

*Sienna stares at the mug.*

**SIENNA**: She did think I was funny. I never understood why. My humor is extremely dry and statistically most people find it alienating.

**KAEL**: I think it's funny.

**SIENNA**: You also collect dead people's memories for a living, so your judgment is questionable.

*The tiniest pause. Then Kael laughs, and Sienna -- who did not expect that -- almost smiles.*

---

### BOND-12: Nyx and Ash (Two Children)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 14, Nyx and Ash both in party
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Nyx, Ash (others observe from distance)
**Time**: Afternoon, camp set up early
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

The two youngest members of the party, playing. If you can call it that. Nyx is an Echo made of starlight and questions. Ash is an eight-year-old who communicates through emotion. Neither of them quite understands the rules.

### The Conversation

*Nyx and Ash sit facing each other in the grass. Ash has a collection of small stones arranged in a pattern -- apparently a game, though no one else can parse the rules. Ash places a stone. Nyx tilts their head.*

**NYX**: That one means rain.

*Ash nods. Places another.*

**NYX**: That one means... being hungry but not for food.

*Ash pauses. Their eyes shift to blue -- surprise. They nod slowly. They place a third stone.*

**NYX**: I don't have a word for that one.

*Ash sends a feeling: the sensation of picking up something heavy and discovering it's lighter than you expected. Relief and confusion at the same time.*

**NYX**: Oh. That's a good one.

*Kael watches from across the camp. Garrick stands beside them.*

**GARRICK**: What are they doing?

**KAEL**: I have absolutely no idea.

**GARRICK**: Should we be worried?

*Nyx picks up a stone and holds it to their cheek. Their starfield eyes pulse. Ash claps silently, delighted.*

**KAEL**: I don't think so. I think they're making a language.

**GARRICK**: Out of rocks.

**KAEL**: Out of feelings. The rocks are just... punctuation.

*Garrick watches for a long time. Two children who aren't quite human, inventing a way to talk to each other that no one has ever used before. His hand finds the spot on his breastplate where Ash's drawing lives.*

**GARRICK**: ...That's the most hopeful thing I've seen in thirty years.

### BOND-13: Lyra and Sienna (Across Time)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 14, bond level Lyra+Sienna >= 1
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Lyra, Sienna
**Time**: Late night
**Estimated Duration**: 3 minutes

### Setting

Two scientists. Three hundred years apart. The same guilt. Sienna is running numbers on a datapad. Lyra is more solid than she was last week -- three fragments recovered now.

### The Conversation

*Lyra drifts to where Sienna is working. Her crystalline form casts prism-light across Sienna's notes.*

**LYRA**: You're recalculating the Resonance decay curves.

*Sienna jumps. She still hasn't gotten used to Lyra appearing.*

**SIENNA**: Don't— yes. Your data from the Nexus site is three hundred years old. Decay coefficients have shifted.

**LYRA**: By how much?

**SIENNA**: Fourteen percent. Which means your original Severance thresholds were... actually quite accurate, given the instrumentation you had. Better than I would have—

*She stops. Realizes what she's saying.*

**SIENNA**: I mean. The math was good. The... other parts of the project. Less so.

**LYRA**: You can say it. The project that destroyed the world.

**SIENNA**: Before your time, we called it "the greatest scientific achievement in human history." After, we called it "the Severance." Same project. Different framing.

*Lyra sits -- lowers herself onto a log. She's solid enough for that now. The wood creaks under her weight. They both notice.*

**LYRA**: You know what I miss most? Not the world before. Not the people. I miss the certainty. I was so sure we were right. Every equation confirmed it. Every test. We were going to unify human consciousness and it was going to be beautiful.

**SIENNA**: I know that feeling. I had it too. Standing in my lab, looking at the Resonance integration data, thinking: this is the thing that fixes everything. This is the paper they'll remember me for.

**LYRA**: And now?

**SIENNA**: Now they'll remember me for subject-- for the people I--

*Her hands shake. She puts the datapad down.*

**LYRA**: We're the same person, Sienna. Different centuries, same arrogance. We looked at the data and forgot that data comes from people.

**SIENNA**: ...You know what's funny? Not funny. The opposite of funny. When I read your old research notes -- the ones Kael recovered -- I thought: she's brilliant. She should have known better.

**LYRA**: I should have.

**SIENNA**: And then I thought: so should I. And I did it anyway. Which means knowing better doesn't actually help.

*Long silence. Somewhere, Garrick's fire pops.*

**LYRA**: Then what does?

**SIENNA**: I don't know. Keeping the mug. Remembering the names. Not letting yourself forget what "moderate risk" actually meant.

*Lyra's hand -- translucent, cool -- rests briefly on Sienna's shoulder. Sienna flinches, then doesn't.*

**LYRA**: For what it's worth: the fact that you kept the mug makes you different from me. I destroyed my reminders. I fragmented myself so I wouldn't have to carry it whole.

**SIENNA**: And I kept every reminder I could find and carry them all at once. I'm not sure that's healthier.

**LYRA**: Probably not. But it's braver.

---

### BOND-14: Iris and Kael (The Watch)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 15 (Siege of Emberhearth), bond level Kael+Iris >= 3
**Location**: Camp, post-siege
**Party**: Kael, Iris
**Time**: Deep night, post-battle insomnia
**Estimated Duration**: 3 minutes

### Setting

Everyone else is asleep or pretending to be. Kael and Iris sit on a ridge overlooking their camp. The Scorched Road stretches south. Neither of them can sleep.

### The Conversation

*Iris hasn't spoken in two hours. She's been staring north. Her prosthetic hand opens and closes slowly -- not maintenance, just movement. Something to do.*

**KAEL**: You don't have to talk.

**IRIS**: I know.

*Twenty minutes of silence. Stars. Wind.*

**IRIS**: During the siege, when the wall came down, I counted sixteen dead in the first thirty seconds. I know because I counted. That's what I do. I count things.

**KAEL**: Iris—

**IRIS**: I'm not looking for comfort. I'm looking for... I don't know. Witness. I want someone to know that I counted, and that the number was sixteen, and that I kept fighting anyway.

*Kael looks at her.*

**KAEL**: Sixteen.

**IRIS**: Sixteen.

*She lets out a breath.*

**IRIS**: In the Initiative, they train you not to count. Not the dead -- you count those for the reports. They train you not to count the ones you could have saved. Because that number is always bigger, and it breaks you.

**KAEL**: What number is it?

**IRIS**: For Emberhearth? I don't know. I stopped counting the ones I could have saved after the Initiative. I only count the dead now.

**KAEL**: That sounds like progress.

**IRIS**: It sounds like giving up.

**KAEL**: Maybe those are the same thing sometimes.

*She looks at Kael. Really looks. Her eyes are red-rimmed and her jaw is set and her prosthetic hand is still opening and closing, and she's the most real person Kael has ever seen.*

**IRIS**: ...Sixteen. And I kept fighting. That's the thing I need you to know.

**KAEL**: I know. I saw you.

*She nods. Doesn't say thank you. Doesn't need to. They sit on the ridge until dawn, counting nothing.*

### BOND-15: Garrick's Daughter

**Trigger**: After Chapter 16, bond level Kael+Garrick >= 3
**Location**: Camp, quiet night
**Party**: Kael, Garrick
**Time**: Night, Garrick on watch
**Estimated Duration**: 3 minutes

### Setting

Garrick is sitting by a dying fire. He's not polishing the shield tonight. He's just sitting.

### The Conversation

*Kael sits down. Waits. Five minutes. Ten. Garrick speaks first, which almost never happens.*

**GARRICK**: Her name was Mara.

*Kael says nothing. Waits.*

**GARRICK**: She was a healer. Twenty-two years old. She'd gone to a village in the northern Wastes to help with a crystal-sickness outbreak. Simple work. Safe work.

*He stares at the fire.*

**GARRICK**: The Shepherds received intelligence that the village was harboring a Resonance cult. Corrupted crystals. Dangerous contamination. Standard purification order. I led the unit.

**KAEL**: Garrick, you don't have to—

**GARRICK**: We went in at dawn. Burned the crystal stocks. Searched the houses. There was no cult. There never was. The intelligence was wrong. The "corrupted crystals" were healing crystals -- purified, safe, being used in the clinic where my daughter was treating patients.

*The fire pops. Garrick doesn't move.*

**GARRICK**: She was in the clinic when we torched the crystal stores. The blast—

*He stops.*

**GARRICK**: I didn't know she was there. That's what I told myself for fifteen years. I didn't know. And that's true. But I also didn't check. I was so certain. So root deep in my faith that the intelligence was good, the cause was right, the crystals were dangerous. I didn't check.

*Long silence.*

**KAEL**: ...What was she like?

*Garrick looks up. Surprised. People usually say "I'm sorry." Nobody asks what she was like.*

**GARRICK**: Stubborn. Like me. But she used it different. I was stubborn about certainty. She was stubborn about kindness. She'd walk four hours to treat someone with a cold because she said "sickness is sickness and distance is just walking."

*The faintest smile.*

**GARRICK**: She made terrible stew.

**KAEL**: Worse than yours?

**GARRICK**: Nobody's stew is worse than mine. But hers was close. She'd put anything in it. Once she added honey because a patient told her it had healing properties. Honey. In stew.

*Kael almost laughs. Doesn't quite.*

**GARRICK**: The stew I make now -- the one everyone eats and nobody complains about -- it's her recipe. With the honey taken out. She'd be furious about the honey.

*He touches his breastplate. The drawing. The emblem.*

**GARRICK**: There might be an Echo of her. In the Hollows. Sienna says the Nexus preserves everyone who died near high-Resonance sites.

**KAEL**: Do you want to find it?

**GARRICK**: I don't know. I don't know if I want to see her. I don't know if she'd want to see me.

*The fire dies to embers. Kael doesn't try to rebuild it.*

**KAEL**: If we find her... whatever you decide, I'll be there.

**GARRICK**: ...Thank you. For asking what she was like. People don't.

### BOND-16: Cipher Teaches Nyx Sarcasm

**Trigger**: After Chapter 12, Cipher and Nyx both in party, bond >= 1
**Location**: Any camp or travel break
**Party**: Cipher, Nyx
**Time**: Daytime, walking break
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

The party has stopped to rest. Cipher is eating a ration bar. Nyx is watching them eat it.

### The Conversation

**NYX**: That bar smells like sadness.

**CIPHER**: It tastes like sadness too. Initiative surplus rations. Designed to provide maximum nutrition with minimum flavor. Because joy is inefficient.

**NYX**: ...Is that sarcasm?

**CIPHER**: Getting warmer. Sarcasm is when you say something that means the opposite of what you mean, but the way you say it tells the other person you mean the opposite.

**NYX**: That seems like a very complicated way to communicate.

**CIPHER**: Welcome to being human.

**NYX**: I'm not human.

**CIPHER**: Welcome to being human-adjacent. Close enough for sarcasm privileges.

*Nyx thinks about this.*

**NYX**: So if I said "this is a wonderful conversation" but I said it in the wrong way—

**CIPHER**: The *right* wrong way—

**NYX**: —the right wrong way, then it would mean this is a terrible conversation?

**CIPHER**: Exactly. Try it.

*Nyx draws themselves up. Their starfield eyes narrow. They speak in a pitch-perfect imitation of Iris's flattest military tone:*

**NYX**: This is a wonderful conversation.

*Cipher chokes on their ration bar.*

**CIPHER**: That was— okay, that was terrifying. Don't do Iris's voice. She'll kill both of us.

**NYX**: Was it sarcasm?

**CIPHER**: It was something. I'm not sure "sarcasm" covers it. That was more like... targeted emotional warfare.

**NYX**: Is that different?

**CIPHER**: In Gearhaven, not really.

*Nyx brightens. Literally -- their starfield eyes spark.*

**NYX**: I want to practice. Can I be sarcastic to Garrick?

**CIPHER**: Absolutely not. He won't get it and then he'll be sad and then he'll make sad stew and sad stew is the worst kind of stew.

**NYX**: There are kinds of stew?

**CIPHER**: There are infinite kinds of stew. That's basically Garrick's whole philosophy.

### BOND-17: Sienna and Lyra (The Apology)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 15, Lyra solidity >= 4 fragments, Sienna in party
**Location**: Camp near the Hollows border
**Party**: Sienna, Lyra
**Time**: Early morning
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

The party is camped at the edge of the Hollows approach. The sky looks wrong here -- slightly too many colors. Sienna is packing her equipment. Lyra is standing at the camp's edge, looking toward the Hollows. She's more solid than ever -- you can barely see through her now.

### The Conversation

*Sienna approaches Lyra. Stops. Starts to turn back. Stops again.*

**SIENNA**: Dr. Reyes.

*Lyra turns. She's stopped correcting people who call her "doctor." It's easier than explaining that her degree expired three centuries ago.*

**LYRA**: Sienna.

**SIENNA**: I need to say something and I need to say it before we go in there because once we're in the Hollows everything becomes about survival and I'll lose the nerve.

*She takes off her glasses. Puts them back on.*

**SIENNA**: I read your contingency notes. The ones you encrypted before the Severance. "If the Convergence fractures, ensure the Anchors are hidden. If the Anchors are found, ensure they choose freely. If they can't choose freely, ensure they can't be used."

**LYRA**: I remember writing those. Barely.

**SIENNA**: You tried to protect them. The Anchors. From people exactly like me.

*Lyra doesn't respond.*

**SIENNA**: I want to apologize. Not for what I did to specific people -- that list is too long and I'll run out of morning. I want to apologize for being what you were afraid of. A scientist who saw Resonance as a tool and people as data. You wrote those contingencies because you knew someone like me would come along. And you were right. And I'm sorry.

*Lyra is quiet for a long time.*

**LYRA**: I wasn't afraid of someone like you, Sienna. I was afraid of someone like *me*. I did the same thing. Three hundred years earlier, with better intentions, and the same result.

**SIENNA**: The Severance.

**LYRA**: I looked at the Convergence and saw a tool. I told myself it was for humanity's benefit. And eight hundred million people paid for my certainty.

*She turns to face Sienna fully. Two scientists. Same crime. Different centuries.*

**LYRA**: I don't accept your apology. Not because you don't deserve forgiveness -- because I'm not the person you owe it to. The people in those labs are. The ones you can still reach.

**SIENNA**: Some of them are past reaching.

**LYRA**: Then reach the ones who aren't. That's all any of us can do.

*Sienna nods. Puts her glasses on straight. Looks toward the Hollows.*

**SIENNA**: ...For what it's worth, your encrypted contingencies? Brilliant encryption. I almost didn't crack it. The Resonance-layered cipher was generations ahead of anything I'd seen.

**LYRA**: I was the best Resonance physicist in the world.

**SIENNA**: You were the second best.

*The faintest ghost of a smile between them. Professional respect, across an impossible gap.*

### BOND-18: Group Scene -- Garrick's Stew (The Verdict)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 16, full party available
**Location**: Camp, evening
**Party**: Everyone
**Time**: Evening, first calm night in a week
**Estimated Duration**: 3 minutes

### Setting

Garrick has made stew. He's used Emberhearth spices this time, traded from an Ash Walker merchant. The pot is large. The fire is warm. Everyone is eating. This is the most normal thing that has happened in weeks.

### The Conversation

*Garrick ladles stew into bowls. Hands them out. His face is neutral. He always looks neutral when he cooks. It's the same face he makes when he's blocking a hit -- pure concentration.*

**IRIS**: *eating* This is different from last time.

**GARRICK**: Different spices.

**IRIS**: What spices?

**GARRICK**: Ash pepper. Ember root. And something the merchant called "fire salt" which I think is just salt that's been near a volcano.

**CIPHER**: Is there a difference between regular salt and salt that's been near a volcano?

**GARRICK**: The volcano salt costs more.

*Sienna takes a small bite. Writes something in her notebook.*

**KAEL**: Sienna, are you taking notes on the stew?

**SIENNA**: I'm recording the ingredient ratios. In case he dies and someone needs to replicate it. This is preservation of critical knowledge.

**GARRICK**: I'm not going to die.

**SIENNA**: Everyone dies. Your stew shouldn't.

*Nyx is holding a bowl. They can't eat, exactly, but they hold it close to their face and breathe in.*

**NYX**: I think I understand food now.

**CIPHER**: You don't eat.

**NYX**: I understand it *conceptually*. It's not about the nutrients. Iris was wrong.

**IRIS**: I'm going to need people to stop telling me I was wrong about the nutrient thing.

**NYX**: You were wrong about the nutrient thing.

**IRIS**: Thank you, Nyx. That's very helpful.

**NYX**: Was that sarcasm? Cipher is teaching me sarcasm.

**CIPHER**: I'm regretting teaching them sarcasm.

*Ash is eating quietly. Their bowl is half-empty. They look up at Garrick and send a wave of feeling across the camp: warmth, safety, the specific comfort of being full when you've been hungry. It hits everyone differently. Iris blinks. Cipher puts their spoon down. Kael smiles.*

*Lyra takes a spoonful. She can eat now -- barely. Mostly she tastes it as memory. The flavor hits her like someone else's nostalgia.*

**LYRA**: Before the Severance, we had machines that could synthesize any flavor. Any meal, perfectly replicated. We thought we'd made cooking obsolete.

**GARRICK**: What happened?

**LYRA**: People kept cooking anyway. The machines were perfect. The home-cooked meals were better.

*Garrick says nothing. But his spoon stirs the pot with the particular rhythm of a man who has been told he is right about something he already knew.*

### BOND-19: Kael's Journal

**Trigger**: After Chapter 18 (Kael's origin reveal), bond Kael+any >= 2
**Location**: Camp, post-revelation
**Party**: Kael alone (any party member can trigger the scene)
**Time**: Night, Kael awake
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Kael is sitting apart from the group. Their journal is open but they haven't written anything. The page is blank. For the first time in the story, Kael doesn't know what to draw.

### The Conversation

*[This scene can play with ANY party member who approaches. The opener is the same; the middle varies.]*

**Universal opener:**

*Kael hears footsteps. Doesn't look up.*

**KAEL**: I'm fine.

*[Party member sits down.]*

**KAEL**: I'm not fine.

---

**IRIS variant:**

**IRIS**: I know.

*She sits. Doesn't touch Kael. Doesn't try to fix it.*

**KAEL**: You're not going to say anything?

**IRIS**: What do you want me to say? "It doesn't matter what you are"? It matters. "You're still you"? I don't know if you're still you. You don't know either. So I'm not going to lie.

*Kael looks at her.*

**IRIS**: I'm going to sit here. Because you're the person who handed me tea when I was counting exits. And whatever you are, that person did that. So I'm sitting.

---

**GARRICK variant:**

**GARRICK**: Not-fine is honest. That's good.

*Long silence. Garrick puts a bowl of stew down next to Kael. Kael doesn't touch it.*

**GARRICK**: When I left the Shepherds, I couldn't eat for a week. Not because I wasn't hungry. Because I didn't know if I deserved to be hungry. If I deserved to have a body that wanted things.

**KAEL**: ...What changed?

**GARRICK**: I ate stew. Terrible stew. Worst I ever had. But my body wanted it. And I thought: whatever I've done, this body is still mine. It's hungry. That's real. Everything else can wait until after dinner.

*Kael picks up the bowl.*

---

**NYX variant:**

**NYX**: Your journal is empty.

**KAEL**: Yeah.

**NYX**: You always draw. Even when things are bad. The drawings get messier but you always draw.

**KAEL**: I don't know what to draw. I don't know what I am. How do you draw yourself when you don't know what you are?

*Nyx sits down. Considers this with absolute seriousness.*

**NYX**: I never knew what I was. I drew things anyway. They weren't me. But making them was.

*Kael stares at the blank page.*

**NYX**: Draw something that isn't you. That's where you start.

*Kael picks up the charcoal. Draws a star. Then another. A small constellation. At the bottom, very small, they write: "Bread."*

*Nyx's eyes brighten.*

---

### BOND-20: Cipher and Ash (The Older Sibling)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 14, bond level Cipher+Ash >= 1
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Cipher, Ash
**Time**: Late afternoon
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Cipher is running diagnostics on their visor. Ash is sitting beside them, watching the data scroll through the translucent display with the focus of someone trying very hard to understand.

### The Conversation

*Cipher glances at Ash. Ash is mimicking Cipher's posture -- legs crossed, leaning forward, chin in hand. Except Ash is eight and the posture looks ridiculous on them.*

**CIPHER**: You don't have to copy me.

*Ash sends a feeling: admiration mixed with curiosity. The emotional equivalent of "but I want to."*

**CIPHER**: Alright. But if you're going to be like me, you should know: I am not a good role model. I count exits. I trust nobody. I once lived in a server room for sixteen years because people were too scary.

*Ash sends another feeling: warm disagreement. Something like "you're wrong about yourself but I won't argue because arguing is loud."*

**CIPHER**: Kid, you can't just hit me with emotions like that. I have defenses. Walls. Very carefully constructed—

*Ash places their hand on Cipher's wrist. A pulse of feeling: safety.*

*Cipher goes very still. Their tattoos stop pulsing. The visor hangs forgotten in their other hand.*

**CIPHER**: ...Okay. That's not fair. That's really not fair.

*Ash just looks at them. Eyes green -- content.*

**CIPHER**: You know what, fine. I'll be your role model. Terrible, paranoid, exit-counting role model. But here's the deal: you don't let anyone use you. Not the Initiative, not the Shepherds, not anyone. You're not a tool. You're not a weapon. You're a kid who does the emotion thing and likes drawing in the dirt and eats Garrick's terrible stew.

*Ash sends a feeling: the stew isn't terrible.*

**CIPHER**: The stew is objectively mid. Don't tell him I said that.

*Ash makes a gesture that Cipher has learned means laughter -- a small, silent shaking of the shoulders.*

**CIPHER**: Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up. Just remember: three exits from this campsite. West, south, and northeast. If anything happens, you take the south one. Creek bed. Running water covers sound. Got it?

*Ash nods solemnly. Then they reach out and adjust Cipher's visor, which was sitting crooked.*

*Cipher lets them.*

---

### BOND-21: Iris and Nyx (What Is Brave?)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 15, bond level Iris+Nyx >= 1
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Iris, Nyx
**Time**: Night watch
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Iris is on watch. Nyx doesn't sleep, so they tend to drift toward whoever is awake.

### The Conversation

**NYX**: Iris.

**IRIS**: What.

**NYX**: During the siege, you ran toward the broken wall. Everyone else ran away from it. You ran toward it.

**IRIS**: That's what soldiers do.

**NYX**: Is that brave?

**IRIS**: No. That's training. Brave would be choosing to run toward it. I didn't choose. My legs just moved.

**NYX**: But you kept running. After your legs moved. You could have stopped.

*Iris is quiet.*

**NYX**: Is bravery the part where you don't stop? Even when the choosing catches up to the training?

**IRIS**: ...Where do you get this stuff?

**NYX**: I observe. I don't understand most of what humans do. But I watch. And sometimes the pattern makes sense after a while.

*Iris looks at Nyx. A child's form, starlight eyes, no mouth, hovering two inches off the ground and asking philosophical questions about courage.*

**IRIS**: You want to know what brave actually is? Brave is Garrick cooking stew after a battle when his hands are shaking. Brave is Sienna writing down the names of people she hurt. Brave is Kael getting up every morning and leading this group when they don't know what they are.

**NYX**: What about you?

**IRIS**: I'm not brave. I'm stubborn. There's a difference.

**NYX**: What's the difference?

**IRIS**: Brave people feel fear and push through. Stubborn people feel fear and get angry at it. I've been angry for twenty-eight years. The wall was just somewhere to put it.

*Nyx tilts their head.*

**NYX**: That might be the saddest brave thing I've heard.

**IRIS**: It wasn't brave—

**NYX**: You just said brave is when you keep going. You keep going. You keep being angry and you keep going. That's brave and stubborn. At the same time. Like Kael talks about two things with one mouth.

*Iris opens her mouth. Closes it. Opens it again.*

**IRIS**: Go to sleep, Nyx.

**NYX**: I don't sleep.

**IRIS**: Then go do whatever the hell it is you do. Float. Look at stars. Stop making me think about things.

*Nyx drifts away. Iris watches them go. Her prosthetic hand opens and closes once -- not maintenance, not nervous energy. Something else.*

---

### BOND-22: Group Scene -- The Night Before the Hollows

**Trigger**: Before Chapter 17, full party, bond total >= 10
**Location**: Last camp before the Hollows
**Party**: Everyone
**Time**: Night, fire, everyone awake
**Estimated Duration**: 3 minutes

### Setting

Nobody can sleep. They're going into the Hollows tomorrow. The fire is big because Garrick built it big on purpose. The kind of fire you build when you want the world to feel smaller and warmer than it is.

### The Conversation

*Silence. Then:*

**CIPHER**: Worst meal you've ever eaten. Go.

**IRIS**: Initiative field rations, day seventeen of a swamp operation. Technically edible. Emotionally devastating.

**CIPHER**: Mine was a fungus I found growing in the server room. I was twelve. I thought it was a mushroom.

**KAEL**: Was it a mushroom?

**CIPHER**: In the same way that rat poison is a condiment. I was sick for three days.

**GARRICK**: Shepherd purification rations. They're designed to taste bad on purpose. Pleasure is distraction. Flavor is indulgence.

**IRIS**: That's the most Shepherd thing I've ever heard.

**SIENNA**: Resonance nutrient gel. The Initiative serves it to long-shift researchers. It has the exact caloric content of a full meal and the taste profile of petroleum mixed with regret.

**KAEL**: Memory honey cake. My neighbor Petra made it when I was eight. She used twice the honey and half the flour. It was basically sweet cement. I chipped a tooth.

*Everyone looks at Nyx.*

**NYX**: I don't eat.

**CIPHER**: Worst thing you've tasted. You taste things. I've seen you lick a crystal.

**NYX**: ...The crystal tasted like being alone.

*Silence. Nobody expected that.*

**NYX**: Is that bad? Was that the wrong answer?

**KAEL**: No, Nyx. That was the right answer.

*Ash, who has been listening, sends a feeling across the camp: the taste of Garrick's stew, warm and imprecise, with too much salt and not enough time, which somehow is exactly right. The feeling says: this is what together tastes like.*

*Nobody says anything for a while. They don't need to. Garrick adds a log to the fire.*

**LYRA**: Before the Severance, there was a tradition. The night before a journey, you'd cook the worst thing you could find and eat it together. So the journey would be an improvement.

**GARRICK**: ...You want me to make bad stew.

**LYRA**: I'm saying the tradition exists.

**GARRICK**: I don't make bad stew.

**SIENNA**: The statement "I don't make bad stew" is not quantitatively verifiable.

**GARRICK**: The statement "I don't make bad stew" is verified by everyone who's eaten my stew.

**CIPHER**: It's fine stew. It's objectively fine stew. Nobody is arguing about the stew.

**NYX**: I think you're all arguing about the stew.

*Iris laughs. A real one. Sudden and surprising and gone almost immediately, but everyone hears it. Ash's eyes flash gold -- joy -- and the feeling pulses outward one more time: together.*

---

### BOND-23: Kael and Cipher (Two Anchors)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 19, bond level Kael+Cipher >= 2
**Location**: Camp near the Hollows exit
**Party**: Kael, Cipher
**Time**: Post-Hollows quiet
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Both Anchors. Both afraid of what that means.

### The Conversation

*Cipher and Kael sit back-to-back, looking at different parts of the sky. It's a position they've settled into naturally -- neither has to see the other's face.*

**CIPHER**: So. Anchors.

**KAEL**: Anchors.

**CIPHER**: Cool. Great. Love having a cosmically important role in the fate of human consciousness. Really what I wanted out of my twenties.

**KAEL**: Thirties.

**CIPHER**: Details.

*Pause.*

**CIPHER**: Does it scare you? The crystallization thing. If we get it wrong.

**KAEL**: Yeah.

**CIPHER**: Good. I thought it was just me. I ran the probability models. There are... a lot of ways this goes bad. And exactly four ways it goes good. Maybe. If "good" is even the right word.

**KAEL**: Cipher... do you count exits for the end of the world?

**CIPHER**: I count exits for everything, Kael. That's literally my whole deal.

*Beat.*

**CIPHER**: I found three. For this. Three exits from the apocalypse. South is Vex's plan -- controlled crystallization, everyone loses autonomy but survives. Northeast is Null's plan -- destroy the crystals, everyone's free but the Convergence dies. And west, through the treeline, bad footing but decent cover -- that's us. Finding a third option.

**KAEL**: What's the bad footing?

**CIPHER**: The bad footing is that we might crystallize. We might die. We might become something that isn't us. And the cover -- the decent cover -- is seven idiots and an Echo who won't let us go in alone.

*Kael leans back against Cipher's back. Feels them breathing.*

**KAEL**: Seven idiots and an Echo seems like pretty good cover.

**CIPHER**: ...It's the best I've ever had.

---

### BOND-24: Sienna Apologizes to Lyra (About Echoes)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 17, Sienna and Nyx both in party
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Sienna, Nyx
**Time**: Morning
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

Sienna is organizing her sample cases. Nyx is sitting nearby, unusually still.

### The Conversation

*Nyx speaks without preamble.*

**NYX**: Sienna. In the Initiative labs, when you studied Echoes -- did you study ones like me?

*Sienna's hands stop. Her pen hovers.*

**SIENNA**: ...What do you mean, "like you"?

**NYX**: Conscious ones. Echoes that knew they were Echoes. That could think and ask questions and be scared.

*Long pause.*

**SIENNA**: Yes. We studied conscious Echoes.

**NYX**: What happened to them?

**SIENNA**: Nyx, I don't think—

**NYX**: I'm asking because I want to know. Not because I want to be upset. I want to know because if I'm going to trust you, I need to know what you did. Cipher says trust is informed. Garrick says trust is chosen. I want both.

*Sienna puts her pen down. Takes off her glasses. Puts them back on.*

**SIENNA**: We dissected them. Resonance dissection. Not physically -- we fragmented their consciousness into component frequencies to study how self-awareness forms in crystalline matrices.

**NYX**: Did they come back?

**SIENNA**: Some of them. Not... all the way back. It's difficult to reassemble a consciousness once it's been--

*She stops. Her hands are shaking badly.*

**SIENNA**: No. Don't soften it. They didn't come back. We took them apart and they didn't come back and I signed the authorizations because the data was extraordinary and the data was more real to me than they were.

*Silence. Nyx's starfield eyes dim, then brighten.*

**NYX**: Okay.

**SIENNA**: Okay?

**NYX**: I asked. You told me. That's trust. The Cipher part -- being informed. Now I need to do the Garrick part. Choosing.

*Pause.*

**NYX**: I choose to trust you. Because you told me the truth. And because your hands are shaking, which means you remember what you did, and you hate it. People who don't hate it don't shake.

*Sienna can't speak for a moment.*

**SIENNA**: ...You're remarkably wise for someone who names stars after bread.

**NYX**: Thank you. That star is doing very well, by the way. I checked.

---

### BOND-25: Garrick and Cipher (Old Soldier, New Thief)

**Trigger**: After Chapter 16, bond level Garrick+Cipher >= 1
**Location**: Any camp
**Party**: Garrick, Cipher
**Time**: Evening, both on watch
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

An unlikely watch pair. The oldest party member and one of the most paranoid. They've worked out a system: Garrick watches the perimeter, Cipher monitors the signals.

### The Conversation

*Long silence. Comfortable. The kind that forms between people who've done night watch together enough times.*

**CIPHER**: You're not going to ask me about the Anchor thing?

**GARRICK**: No.

**CIPHER**: Everyone else asks. Kael asks gently. Iris asks practically. Sienna asks scientifically. You just... don't ask.

**GARRICK**: You'll tell me when you're ready. Asking doesn't make people ready faster.

*Cipher pulls their visor down. Scans. Pulls it up.*

**CIPHER**: You know what? That's the most respectful thing anyone's said to me in... maybe ever. And it was mostly not saying anything.

**GARRICK**: I'm good at not saying anything.

**CIPHER**: You're exceptional at it. It's your best quality.

*Pause.*

**CIPHER**: ...Okay, here's one thing. The Anchor resonance -- it's like being a radio that can't turn off. I hear everything. Every crystal hum, every Echo whisper, every Resonance fluctuation in a hundred-meter radius. It's—

*They tap their temple.*

**CIPHER**: Loud. It's loud. And I can't build a firewall for it. I've tried. You can't hack biology.

**GARRICK**: In the Wastes, the first season I spent away from the Shepherds, the silence nearly killed me. Thirty years of chanting, praying, singing hymns together. Every hour. And then nothing. Just wind and ash.

**CIPHER**: What did you do?

**GARRICK**: Talked to my shield. For about a month. Then I started cooking. Stirring a pot makes noise. Chopping makes noise. It's not chanting, but it's rhythm. It's enough.

*Cipher looks at Garrick with an expression that might be the beginning of understanding.*

**CIPHER**: You're saying I should find a different noise.

**GARRICK**: I'm saying everyone needs a spoon. Something to hold. Something to stir. Doesn't have to be a spoon. Just has to be yours.

*Cipher reaches into their pocket. Pulls out a small device -- the signal scrambler, half-finished, homemade. They turn it over in their hands.*

**CIPHER**: ...This is my spoon.

**GARRICK**: Good spoon.

## Act III Bonding Scenes

### BOND-26: The Last Stew

**Trigger**: Chapter 21, full party gathered
**Location**: Party camp, night before the final push
**Party**: Everyone
**Time**: Night, fire, stars
**Estimated Duration**: 3 minutes

### Setting

Garrick is making stew. Again. For possibly the last time. Nobody says that out loud, but everyone is thinking it. The fire is the biggest he's ever built.

### The Conversation

*The pot is enormous. Garrick has used everything -- Cindral ember root, Verdant forest herbs, Steppes crystal salt, Ironcoast processed protein. Four regions in one pot.*

*He serves without being asked. Bowls go around. Nobody eats immediately. They hold their bowls and look at the fire.*

**GARRICK**: It'll go cold.

*Everyone eats. Slowly. Tasting every spoonful like they're memorizing it.*

**IRIS**: You used the fire salt again.

**GARRICK**: Real fire salt this time. Not volcano-adjacent salt. The Ash Walker merchant in Prismfall confirmed it.

**IRIS**: Is there actually a difference?

**GARRICK**: No.

*She snorts.*

**SIENNA**: I've been tracking the caloric variance across your stew iterations. This one is approximately 12% more calorie-dense than average. Is that intentional?

**GARRICK**: Yes.

**SIENNA**: May I ask why?

**GARRICK**: Long day tomorrow.

*That lands. Nobody says anything for a minute.*

**CIPHER**: So we're all thinking it. This might be the last time we—

**KAEL**: Don't.

**CIPHER**: I'm just saying—

**KAEL**: I know what you're saying. And you're right. But we don't say it. We eat the stew and we sit by the fire and we pretend tomorrow is just another day. Because that's what people do. That's the whole... that's the thing. Being human is pretending the next bowl of stew isn't the last one.

*Nyx looks at Kael.*

**NYX**: Even if you're not human?

*Kael holds their bowl tighter.*

**KAEL**: Especially then.

*Ash, who has been eating quietly, stands up. They walk to each person in the circle. At each stop, they press their forehead to the person's hand. A pulse of feeling -- different for everyone. For Iris: the particular courage of not running. For Garrick: the warmth of a fire that someone else built for you. For Cipher: the safety of a room with no exits, because you don't need one. For Sienna: the forgiveness you can't give yourself, offered from outside. For Nyx: the joy of existing. For Kael: the reality of being real.*

*For Lyra, the last one, Ash holds their hand and sends the longest feeling: memory. All the good ones. Three hundred years of them. Not the Convergence's memories -- Lyra's. The ones she thought she'd lost.*

*Lyra's form shimmers. She is almost entirely solid now. A tear runs down her cheek -- a real tear, from a real face, for the first time in three centuries.*

**LYRA**: ...Thank you.

*Ash sits back down. Picks up their bowl. Keeps eating.*

*Garrick adds another log to the fire.*

### BOND-27: Kael and Lyra (Almost Beautiful)

**Trigger**: Chapter 21, Kael+Lyra bond >= 3
**Location**: Edge of camp, overlooking the Hollows
**Party**: Kael, Lyra
**Time**: After the stew scene, very late
**Estimated Duration**: 2 minutes

### Setting

The recurring refrain. "Almost something beautiful." Kael and Lyra at the edge of the world, looking at the thing they're going to walk into.

### The Conversation

*Lyra stands at the camp's edge. She's solid now -- almost entirely. Moonlight doesn't pass through her anymore. The Hollows shimmer on the horizon, a smear of wrong colors against the night.*

*Kael joins her.*

**KAEL**: You remember all of it now.

**LYRA**: Most of it. The music is still fragments. But the rest... yes. I remember the day before the Severance. The labs. The excitement. Dr. Chen brought champagne. We were so sure.

**KAEL**: Do you wish you didn't remember?

**LYRA**: Every moment. And I wouldn't give any of it back.

*Pause. The Hollows pulse, faintly, like breathing.*

**KAEL**: Back in Prismfall -- the first time you said "we were almost something beautiful." About the Convergence. Do you still believe that?

**LYRA**: I believe we were something. Whether it was beautiful depends on what happens tomorrow.

**KAEL**: No pressure.

**LYRA**: All the pressure. *She almost smiles.* Kael... whatever happens in the Nexus. Whatever choice you make. You should know: I'm not afraid of ending. I'm afraid of ending without knowing if it mattered.

**KAEL**: It mattered. Lyra. The three notes. The stew. Nyx naming a star after bread. Cipher counting exits and sitting down anyway. It mattered.

**LYRA**: That's not what I—

**KAEL**: I know what you meant. The big question. Did the Convergence matter, did the Severance matter, does any of it add up to something. And the answer is: I don't know. But the stew mattered. That I know.

*Lyra looks at Kael for a long time. The fragment of the Convergence that walks and talks and makes bad jokes. The person she's been guiding and being guided by for months. The answer to a question she asked three hundred years ago.*

**LYRA**: Almost something beautiful.

**KAEL**: Almost.

*They stand together at the edge, looking at what comes next.*
