# Economy & Inventory Design

## Currency: Resonance Credits (RC)

RC is the primary medium of exchange in Aethermoor.
- **Physical Form:** Standardized crystal chips tuned to a neutral frequency.
- **Acquisition:** Defeating enemies, completing quests, selling items, and finding loot caches.
- **Usage:** Purchasing equipment, items, Echoes, and paying for services like Inn stays or Resonance Tuning.

## Item Classification

Every item in the inventory belongs to one of four categories:

1.  **Consumables:** Single-use items for healing, restoration, or temporary buffs.
2.  **Materials:** Ingredients used for cooking or Echo Tuning (e.g., Ash Salt, Scrap Metal).
3.  **Echo Fragments:** Specialized resources for combat, tuning, and lore.
4.  **Key Items:** Story-critical objects that cannot be sold or discarded.

## Rarity System

Standardized across all items, equipment, and Echoes to provide immediate visual feedback.

| Tier | Color | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common** | White | Mass-produced or common natural finds. |
| **Uncommon** | Blue | Higher quality or rare natural occurrences. |
| **Rare** | Purple | Specialized gear or intense memory fragments. |
| **Legendary** | Gold | Pre-Severance masterpieces or world-changing Echoes. |
| **Unique** | Rainbow | One-of-a-kind story items or character-specific gear. |

## Inventory Management

- **Capacity:** The party has 99 slots per item type. Key items do not count toward limits.
- **Sorting:** Auto-sort options by Name, Rarity, or Category.
- **Quick Access:** Up to 4 items can be assigned to a "Quick Belt" for faster use in combat menus.

## Shop Mechanics

### Standard Merchants
Most towns feature standard shops that accept RC. Prices are fixed but can be influenced by certain "Trader" skill tree perks or high Bond levels with local NPCs.

### Resonant Barter (The Hollows & Steppes)
Specialized traders who do not trust digital or physical RC. They require **Emotional Barter**:
- **Trade:** Echo Fragments of specific types (e.g., "3 Sorrow-type Echoes for this Rare Dagger").
- **Tuning Services:** Often requires specific materials plus an RC fee.

### Black Markets (Gearhaven Undercity)
Features restricted Initiative technology or "Grey-Market" Echoes. 
- **Risk:** Higher prices, but offers items unavailable elsewhere.
- **Access:** Often requires completing a specific side quest ("Undercity Blues").
