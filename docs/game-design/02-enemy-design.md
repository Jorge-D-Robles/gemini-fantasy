# Enemy Design & Bestiary

## Enemy Design Philosophy

Enemies in Aethermoor are not just combat obstacles—they're part of the world's tragedy. Most are victims of The Severance: corrupted by crystal energy, lost Echoes given form, or desperate survivors.

### Enemy Categories

2. **Crystalline Constructs** - Autonomous crystal formations
3. **Echo Manifestations** - Memories given dangerous physical form
4. **Human Enemies** - Initiative soldiers, Shepherds, bandits
5. **Aberrations** - Beings from The Hollows, reality made wrong
6. **Bosses** - Unique, story-significant encounters
