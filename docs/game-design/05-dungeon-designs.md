# Detailed Dungeon Designs

## Dungeon Design Philosophy

Dungeons in Gemini Fantasy are:
- **Narratively integrated**: Each tells part of the world's story
- **Mechanically distinct**: Unique puzzles and challenges
- **Visually memorable**: Strong environmental identity
- **Respectfully sized**: 30-90 minutes, no padding
- **Rewardingly explored**: Secrets for thorough players
