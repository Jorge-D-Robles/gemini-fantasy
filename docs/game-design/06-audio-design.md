# Audio & Music Design

## Audio Philosophy

Music and sound in Gemini Fantasy serve three purposes:
1. **Emotional resonance** - Enhance narrative and themes
2. **World building** - Each region has distinct audio identity
3. **Gameplay feedback** - Communicate mechanics through sound

## Composer Direction

### Style References

**Inspirations to Share with Composer**:

- Chrono Trigger (Yasunori Mitsuda): Time/memory themes
- Persona 5 (Shoji Meguro): Stylish, genre-blending
- Undertale (Toby Fox): Motif evolution, emotional weight

### Core Direction

**What to Communicate**:
- Themes of memory, identity, connection

- Ancient meets modern
- Organic meets synthetic
- Individual themes must work together (like characters)
- Music IS a character in this story

**Audio is half the experience. In a game about memory and emotion, what players hear is as important as what they see.**
