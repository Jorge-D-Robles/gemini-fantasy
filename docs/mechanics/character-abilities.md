## Design Notes

**Balance Philosophy**:
- Every character has unique role but can be built flexibly
- No "required" characters for any content
- Skill trees allow specialization without forcing it
- Late-game builds can become highly specialized or remain generalized

**Progression Feel**:
- Start with basic abilities
- Gradually unlock more complex options
- Skill trees provide meaningful choices
- Limit Breaks are earned through story and relationships

**Synergies**:
- Characters combo well together (Kael + anyone)
- Some abilities specifically synergize (Iris's debuffs + Cipher's speed)
- Party composition matters but isn't rigid
- Experimentation is rewarded
