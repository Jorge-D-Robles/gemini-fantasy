# World Overview: The Shattered Epoch

## The World of Aethermoor

Aethermoor is a world where ancient technology and magic have become indistinguishable. Once a thriving civilization powered by **Resonance Crystals**—crystallized fragments of collective human emotion and memory—the world fractured 300 years ago during an event known as **The Severance**.

## Geography

### The Five Domains

1. **Cindral Wastes** (North)
   - Volcanic wastelands where the first Resonance reactors melted down
   - Home to nomadic Ash Walkers who've adapted to toxic environments
   - Ancient machinery still hums beneath the cracked earth
   - Major settlement: **Emberhearth**, a city built inside a dormant caldera

2. **Verdant Tangle** (East)
   - Overgrown forests where nature has reclaimed old cities
   - Crystal corruption has created sentient plant life
   - The ruins of the old capital lie hidden beneath the canopy
   - Major settlement: **Roothollow**, a village built in massive tree trunks

3. **Crystalline Steppes** (South)
   - Endless grasslands dotted with crystallized battlefields from The Severance
   - Nomadic traders and scholars traverse the plains
   - Home to the largest free Resonance Crystal deposits
   - Major settlement: **Prismfall**, a trading hub at the edge of a crystal canyon

4. **Ironcoast Federation** (West)
   - Coastal industrial cities attempting to rebuild pre-Severance technology
   - Heavy regulation and corporate control
   - Most technologically advanced but spiritually bankrupt
   - Major settlement: **Gearhaven**, a sprawling port city of smokestacks and skyscrapers

5. **The Hollows** (Center)
   - The epicenter of The Severance
   - Reality is unstable here—time flows strangely, space folds impossibly
   - No permanent settlements, but treasure hunters and researchers brave its depths
   - Contains the **Resonance Nexus**, the source of all crystal energy

## The Severance

Three centuries ago, humanity discovered how to harvest and amplify human consciousness itself through Resonance Crystals. These crystals could store memories, emotions, and even fragments of personality. Society advanced rapidly, creating:

- **Memory Engines** that could share knowledge instantly
- **Emotional Resonators** that could spread peace and happiness
- **Consciousness Networks** that connected minds across continents

But the technology had a fatal flaw: it required constant input of genuine human experience to remain stable. As society became more dependent on the crystals, people began living vicariously through stored memories rather than creating new ones. The feedback loop weakened the crystals until they shattered catastrophically.

The Severance tore apart the global consciousness network, fragmenting not just society but reality itself. The Hollows formed where the main Nexus once stood. Billions of memories scattered into the world as "Echo Fragments"—autonomous crystal shards that replay moments from lost lives.

## Current State of the World

### The Three Factions

**The Reclamation Initiative** (Ironcoast Federation)
- Believes technology can fix what technology broke
- Seeks to rebuild the Resonance network "properly" this time
- Corporate-military structure, well-funded but morally flexible
- Led by Director Vex Thornwright

**The Shepherds of Silence**
- Believes all Resonance technology must be destroyed
- Views The Severance as divine punishment for hubris
- Religious zealots with some legitimate points about crystal addiction
- Led by the mysterious Prophet Null

**The Free Resonants**
- Believes humans and crystals can coexist through balance
- Decentralized movement of scholars, refugees, and idealists
- Seeks to understand the crystals rather than exploit or destroy them
- No single leader, operates through councils

### Daily Life

Most people live in small settlements, wary of crystal technology but unable to completely abandon it. Resonance crystals still power lights, preserve food, and store basic information. The difference is scale and intention.

Echoes—fragments of crystallized memories—appear randomly. Some are harmless (a child's laughter, a sunset), others dangerous (a soldier's final moments, a lover's betrayal made manifest). Echo Hunters make a living capturing or dispelling dangerous fragments.

Ancient ruins dot the landscape, filled with pre-Severance technology that's both invaluable and potentially catastrophic. Adventurers, researchers, and desperate people all seek these sites for different reasons.

## Magic System: Resonance

Magic in Aethermoor isn't mystical—it's the manipulation of crystallized consciousness:

- **Echo Binding**: Capturing and using memory fragments for effects
- **Resonance Tuning**: Harmonizing with crystals to enhance abilities
- **Emotional Channeling**: Using your own feelings to power effects
- **Memory Weaving**: Combining fragments to create new abilities

The cost: every time you use Resonance, you crystallize a tiny part of yourself. Heavy users risk becoming "Hollow"—losing their personality and becoming empty vessels. This creates a natural risk-reward mechanic.

## Themes

- **Memory vs. Experience**: Is a recorded memory as valuable as living one?
- **Progress vs. Preservation**: Should we embrace technology or fear it?
- **Identity**: What makes you *you* if consciousness can be copied?
- **Connection vs. Independence**: The old world was connected but controlled; the new world is free but isolated
- **Hope from Ruin**: Beauty and meaning can emerge from catastrophe
