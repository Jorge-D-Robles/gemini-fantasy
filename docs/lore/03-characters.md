**Personal Subplot**:
As a Resonance Anchor, they can interface with technology in unprecedented ways, but this also means tech can interface with them. They're terrified of being hacked—of someone else controlling their body. Late game, this fear becomes reality, and the party must save them while they fight for control from within.

**Key Relationships**:
- **With Kael**: Mutual understanding of being hunted for what you are
- **With Iris**: Friendship forged in shared escape from Initiative

Her fragmentation was partially intentional, but she can't remember why. Each fragment reveals she was hiding different things from different factions. By becoming whole, she may trigger contingencies she set 300 years ago—which might save or doom the world.

**Key Relationships**:
- **With Kael**: Mentor who becomes student when Kael's nature is revealed
- **With Sienna**: Scientific peers across time, shared burden of catastrophic mistakes
- **With The Convergence**: Creator, destroyer, and ultimately mediator

**Key Relationships**:
- **With Cipher**: Older sibling dynamic, Cipher deeply protective
- **With Nyx**: Two children who aren't quite human, playmates and mirrors
- **With Ash Walkers**: Their adoptive community who will fight and die to protect them

## Major NPCs

### Director Vex Thornwright
**Antagonist, Reclamation Initiative**

**Appearance**: Sharp suit, gray temples, cold eyes, every inch the corporate villain—but truly believes he's saving humanity.

**Motivation**: Lost his family in post-Severance collapse. Believes only total control of Resonance can prevent future catastrophe. Sees people as resources to be optimized. Genuinely thinks he's the hero.

**Complexity**: Will sacrifice anything for "the greater good," but his greater good would save billions. Is he wrong?

---

### Prophet Null
**Antagonist, Shepherds of Silence**

**Appearance**: Hooded figure whose face is never seen clearly. Speaks with voice of crowds. Gender ambiguous.

**Motivation**: Witnessed loved ones become Hollow from Resonance addiction. Believes all crystal technology is existential threat. Willing to commit genocide to "save" humanity's souls.

**Complexity**: Has survived multiple assassination attempts by becoming partially crystalline—the thing she hates most. This hypocrisy eats at her, making her more extreme.

---

### The Convergence
**???**

Not a character but a presence. The collective consciousness of all humanity, fragmented and scattered. Doesn't have a single voice or motivation—it's millions of contradictory desires. Ultimately wants to exist but not at cost of erasing what it's made of. The tragedy: it can't solve this paradox alone.

---

## Character Design Notes

- **Diversity**: Cast represents different ages, bodies, ethnicities, genders, sexualities
- **Trauma**: Every character has legitimate pain; none are "fixed" by adventure
- **Growth**: Arcs about acceptance and action, not about becoming different people
- **Relationships**: Multiple romance options (Iris, Cipher, Lyra), all optional, all treated with maturity
- **Disability**: Iris's prosthetic, Sienna's tremors, various PTSD presentations, all portrayed respectfully
- **Queerness**: Normalized—Kael, Nyx, Cipher, Ash are non-binary; sexuality spectrum represented
