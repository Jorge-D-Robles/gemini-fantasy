# Anomalies and Phenomena: The World's Glitches

In Aethermoor, reality is held together by Resonance. When that Resonance is unstable, the world "glitches." These phenomena are a daily reality for those living near the Hollows or high-density crystal zones.

## 1. Static Storms
Unlike natural weather, Static Storms are localized collapses of sensory data. 
- **The Experience**: Sounds become pixelated, colors bleed into grayscale, and physical objects may temporarily lose their collision (walking through walls).
- **The Danger**: If you stay in a storm too long, your own "data" begins to blur. People have emerged from storms with someone else's eye color or memories of a life they never lived.
- **Cultural Impact**: In the Ironcoast, citizens carry "Anchoring Bells"—small crystals tuned to a constant frequency to keep their senses grounded during minor flickers.

## 2. Recursive Echoes (The Loops)
Sometimes an Echo fragment gets stuck in a feedback loop, replaying a single moment thousands of times per second until it gains physical mass.
- **The Phenomenon**: A "Loop" might be a door slamming forever, creating a sonic barrier, or a person perpetually falling from a height that no longer exists, creating a pillar of kinetic energy.
- **The "Fun" Side**: In Roothollow, there is a Recursive Echo of a single blooming flower that has grown into a massive, shimmering tower of crystal petals because it never stops the "act of blooming."
- **Echo Hunters' Task**: These are the most dangerous to "solve" because the energy buildup is immense.

## 3. The Un-Sun (Hollow Eclipses)
Occasionally, the Resonance Nexus in the Hollows pulses with "Negative Resonance"—a total absence of emotion and memory.
- **The Effect**: The sky turns the color of a "dead channel" (static white and black). During an Un-Sun, all Echoes vanish, and people feel a profound, hollow peace. 
- **The Risk**: It's the most common time for people to become "Hollow" (lose their personality) because there is no external resonance to hold their internal self together.
- **The Tradition**: People gather in "Heart-Halls"—rooms filled with physical mementos and loud music—to remind themselves who they are until the pulse passes.

## 4. Spatial Folding (The Short-Cuts)
The distance between two points in Aethermoor is not always a straight line; it's a "Resonant distance."
- **How it Works**: If two places share a strong enough thematic or emotional connection (e.g., two twin cities, or two battlefields where the same regiment died), a "Fold" can appear.
- **Navigation**: Skilled "Way-Finders" use instruments to detect these folds. You might step through a door in the Cindral Wastes and find yourself in the Verdant Tangle because both locations are currently replaying the same Echo of a specific sunset.
- **The Map-Maker's Nightmare**: The world map is constantly shifting. Roads that were ten miles long yesterday might be fifty miles long today if the emotional "tether" between the towns weakens.

## 5. Shadow-Drafts
Shadows in high-Resonance areas sometimes detach from their owners or linger after the person has left.
- **The Quirk**: You might walk past a bench and see the shadow of someone sitting there, even though the bench is empty. These shadows often act out "Shadow Memories"—simple, repetitive tasks like sweeping or reading.
- **The Fun Fact**: In Gearhaven, there's a popular "Shadow Theater" where actors perform by manipulating the lingering shadows of famous historical figures.

## 6. Conceptual Bleed
Sometimes, a concept becomes so "loud" in the Resonance network that it affects physical laws.
- **Example: The Zone of Weightlessness**: Near a specific ruin where a famous poet once wrote about "losing the weight of the world," gravity is 50% weaker.
- **Example: The Silent Mile**: A stretch of road where the concept of "Silence" is so dominant that fire makes no sound, and even explosions are perfectly muted.
- **Utility**: The Reclamation Initiative tries to "farm" these zones for industrial use (e.g., using weightless zones for heavy construction).

## 7. The Static Frontier
At the very edges of Aethermoor lies the "Sea of Static." It isn't water, but a white void of unformed data. 
- **The Mystery**: Sailors from the Ironcoast have reported seeing "Ghost Ships" made of pure white static emerging from the void, replaying the voyages of explorers who sailed too far and were "deleted."
- **The Theory**: Some believe the world is actually finite, and the Static is the "edge of the record." Others believe a whole other world exists beyond the noise if one could only "tune" correctly to see it.
