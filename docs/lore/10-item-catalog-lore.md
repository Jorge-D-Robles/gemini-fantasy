# Item Catalog: The Objects of Aethermoor

In the world of Aethermoor, mundane survival items are intrinsically linked to the Resonance network and the memories of the people who used them.

## Consumables (The Echoes of Health)

### **Vitality Echo** (Traditional: Potion)
A small vial containing a high-frequency, stable memory of physical wellness. When consumed, the body’s own resonance harmonizes with the memory, rapidly repairing tissues and closing wounds.
- **Visual:** A swirling, pale-green liquid that glows when shaken.

### **Focus Fragment** (Traditional: Ether)
A crystalline shard containing a distilled moment of pure mental clarity. Users crush the shard and inhale the dust, instantly restoring Emotional Energy (EE) and clearing the fog of mental fatigue.
- **Visual:** A sharp, translucent blue needle.

### **Second Breath Crystal** (Traditional: Phoenix Down)
A specialized resonator tuned to the exact frequency of a beating human heart. When placed on the chest of a fallen ally, it releases a powerful kinetic pulse, jolting the consciousness back into the body.
- **Visual:** A bright red, heart-shaped crystal that pulses faintly.

### **Purification Node** (Traditional: Antidote)
A tiny mechanical device that, when activated, vibrates at a frequency that specifically breaks down biological toxins or crystal-corruption at the cellular level.
- **Visual:** A small, brass sphere with spinning outer rings.

### **Grounded Anchor** (Traditional: Remedy)
A multi-frequency device that emits a "White Noise" resonance, shielding the user’s identity and removing all mental debuffs (Fear, Confusion, Charm).

## Materials (The Scraps of Progress)

### **Resonance Dust**
The basic byproduct of shattered crystals. Used as a stabilizer in Tuning and minor repairs.

### **Memory Slag**
Crystallized metal found in reactor meltdowns. Retains heat long after being forged.

### **Initiative Alloy**
A cold, sterile metal used in Federation security drones. High durability, but lacks emotional conduction.

### **Petrified Leaf**
A leaf from the Verdant Tangle that has absorbed so much Echo-Bleed it has become hard as stone while remaining flexible.

## Key Items

### **Anchoring Bell**
A small personal tuning fork that every party member carries. It allows them to use the **Ground** command by striking it to remind a Hollowed ally of the world’s shared frequency.

### **Lyra's Locket**
The first object Kael finds containing a fragment of the Conscious Echo. It acts as a compass for finding other fragments.
