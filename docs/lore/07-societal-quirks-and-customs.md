# Societal Quirks and Customs: Living with the Echoes

Life in Aethermoor has produced some unique, and sometimes bizarre, social norms and traditions that would seem alien to anyone else.

## 1. Echo-Naming (The Second Name)
When a child is born, it is common to wait until they encounter their first "Significant Echo."
- **The Custom**: Parents take their child to a "Garden of Echoes." The first Echo the child naturally resonates with (perhaps a fragment of a baker's joy or a sailor's curiosity) determines their "Echo Name."
- **Example**: Kael "Wheat-Joy" or Iris "Steel-Sorrow." 
- **Significance**: It's believed this Echo provides a "soul-anchor," protecting the child from becoming Hollow later in life.

## 2. The Debt of Breath
In the Cindral Wastes, where the air is thick with ash and memory-dust, "clean breath" is a commodity.
- **The Custom**: When a stranger saves your life or does you a great service, you owe them a "Breath-Debt." You must provide them with a purified Resonance Filter or perform a task that "clears the air" between you.
- **Social Stigma**: To have an unpaid Breath-Debt is to be "Choked"—socially shunned until the debt is cleared.

## 3. The Great Forget (The Annual Purge)
Once a year, during the month of *Silence*, many settlements participate in "The Great Forget."
- **The Tradition**: People write down their most painful or burdensome memories of the past year on "Memory Slips" (strips of low-grade crystal) and cast them into a communal furnace.
- **The Purpose**: It is a collective act of hygiene to prevent the buildup of "Grief-Static" in the local Resonance field, which can attract dangerous Echoes.
- **The Catch**: Some people become "Memory Thieves," sneaking into the furnaces to steal the slips and experience other people's dramas like a soap opera.

## 4. The Table of the Absent
In every home in Roothollow, an extra chair and a small, glowing crystal plate are set at the dinner table.
- **The Belief**: It is for any Echo of a lost ancestor that might manifest during the meal. If an Echo appears, the family speaks to it as if it were the living person, even if the Echo is only replaying a sneeze or a laugh.
- **The Norm**: It is considered extremely rude to sit in the Absent Chair or to point out that the Echo isn't "real."

## 5. Resonance Tattoos (The Soul-Map)
In Gearhaven, citizens often get "Resonance Channels" tattooed onto their skin using ink mixed with crushed crystal dust.
- **The Function**: These tattoos act as external "fuses." If the person experiences a massive emotional spike or Resonance overload, the tattoos glow and burn out, protecting the brain from becoming Hollow.
- **The Fashion**: The patterns of the scars left behind by burnt-out tattoos are seen as badges of "Experience." A person with a clear, unscarred "Soul-Map" is seen as naive or "untested."

## 6. The Language of the One (Glint-Speak)
High-level Resonants and Anchors sometimes slip into "Glint-Speak"—a dialect where sentences are finished with emotional pulses rather than words.
- **The Experience**: You might hear someone say "The sunset was..." followed by a sudden, sharp feeling of nostalgia that hits your chest.
- **Social Impact**: It's considered very intimate. Doing it to a stranger is a major faux pas, akin to reading their private diary.

## 7. The "Hollow-Watch"
When someone begins to show signs of "fading" (losing their personality), their community doesn't just mourn; they hold a "Hollow-Watch."
- **The Vigil**: Friends and family take turns staying with the person 24/7, constantly talking to them, playing their favorite music, and reminding them of their specific quirks.
- **The Goal**: To provide enough "Identity-Static" to keep the person's ego from dissolving into the background Resonance. 
- **The Outcome**: If it fails, the "Hollowed" person is treated with immense respect, often becoming a "Living Monument" in the town square where people leave flowers and Echoes of joy.

## 8. The "False-Past" Industry
In the Ironcoast, there is a thriving black market for "Pre-packaged Identities."
- **The Product**: For a high price, you can buy a set of carefully curated Echoes (a happy childhood, a heroic military career, a prestigious education) and have them "surface-grafted" into your mind.
- **The Users**: Mostly wealthy elites who want to feel like they have a "Legacy" or refugees who want to forget their trauma.
- **The Side Effect**: "Memory Rejection"—where the person's true self fights the graft, leading to hallucinations where they see two versions of every person they know.
