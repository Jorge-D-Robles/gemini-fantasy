# Organic Lore Principles

These principles ensure lore feels human-written, unique, and integrated, avoiding generic AI-generated tropes.

## 1. Show, Don't Tell
- **Environmental Storytelling:** Use the placement of objects, ruins, and NPCs to tell a story without words. A burnt house with a child's toy outside says more than "there was a raid."
- **Lore-Gameplay Integration:** Tie mechanics to the world. If there's a "Resonance" system, it should be reflected in the world's physics, culture, and architecture.
- **Micro-histories:** Focus on the small, personal stories of NPCs that hint at larger world events.

## 2. Deconstruct Tropes
- **Archetype Subversion:** If you have a "Chosen One," give them a reason to hate their fate, or make them incompetent. If you have a "Dark Lord," give them a logical, even sympathetic, goal that happens to conflict with the hero's.
- **Aesthetic Fusion:** Avoid pure "Medieval European Fantasy." Blend elements from different cultures, time periods (steampunk, clockpunk), or completely alien concepts.

## 3. Architectural Storytelling
- **Buildings as Receipts:** Architecture should reflect the history and social status of its inhabitants. Wealthy areas might have ornate, inefficient designs, while poor areas use salvaged materials from ancient ruins.
- **Functional Ruins:** Ruins shouldn't just be "old." They should have had a clear purpose (a factory, a temple, a barracks) and their decay should reflect what happened to that purpose.

## 4. Specificity & Sensory Detail
- **Avoid Generic Descriptors:** Never use "epic," "ancient," or "dark" as primary descriptors. Instead, describe the *smell* of damp stone, the *sound* of wind whistling through a cracked pillar, or the *texture* of moss-covered marble.
- **Cultural Markers:** Give each region unique cultural markers—specific foods, local idioms, clothing styles, and social customs that affect gameplay (e.g., an NPC won't talk to you unless you're wearing a certain accessory).

## 5. Nuanced Character Motivation
- **Internal Conflict:** Every major character should want two things that are mutually exclusive.
- **Distinct Voices:** Each character's dialogue should reflect their upbringing, education, and current mental state. Use specific vocabulary and sentence structures.
- **No Absolute Morality:** Most conflicts should arise from differing perspectives on how to solve a problem, rather than "Good vs. Evil."
