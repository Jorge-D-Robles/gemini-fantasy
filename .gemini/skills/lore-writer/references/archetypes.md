# Nuanced Character Archetypes

Use these as a base, then apply subversion and internal conflict to create unique characters.

## The Reluctant Hero
- **Base:** Destined to save the world but doesn't want to.
- **Twist:** They aren't actually the "Chosen One," but a decoy or a mistake. They have to deal with the imposter syndrome and the real Chosen One's resentment.
- **Internal Conflict:** Duty to others vs. Desire for a quiet life.

## The Scholarly Sage
- **Base:** Wise mentor who knows the lore.
- **Twist:** Their "wisdom" is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of history, or they are hiding a dark secret about the source of their knowledge.
- **Internal Conflict:** Preservation of truth vs. Protection of the people from a dangerous reality.

## The Redeemed Villain
- **Base:** Used to be bad, now trying to be good.
- **Twist:** They aren't seeking "forgiveness" but "utility." They help the hero because it's the most logical path to their own goals. Or, their "evil" past was actually them doing what was necessary for the greater good.
- **Internal Conflict:** Their violent instincts vs. Their new moral code.

## The Innocent Child
- **Base:** Needs protection, represents hope.
- **Twist:** They are actually a vessel for an ancient power or deity and are slowly losing their humanity. Or, they are highly manipulative and use their innocence as a shield.
- **Internal Conflict:** Normal childhood desires vs. The burden of their power.

## The Loyal Knight
- **Base:** Oaths and honor are everything.
- **Twist:** Their oath is to a corrupt institution, and they are struggling to reconcile their personal honor with their orders. Or, their "honor" is a performance to mask deep cowardice.
- **Internal Conflict:** Obedience to authority vs. Moral conscience.
