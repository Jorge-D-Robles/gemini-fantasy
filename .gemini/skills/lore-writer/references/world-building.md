# JRPG World Building Framework

Focus on creating a "lived-in" world with deep history and functional logic.

## History Scaffolding
- **The Before Times:** Define what the world was like before the current status quo. What was the "Golden Age" or the "Great Calamity"?
- **The Transition:** How did the world get from there to here? What were the key wars, technological shifts, or divine interventions?
- **The Present Tension:** What is the primary conflict *now*? This should be a direct result of the past.

## Regional Identity
- **Geography as Destiny:** How does the terrain affect the culture? A mountain people will have different gods, architecture, and food than a desert people.
- **Language & Idioms:** Create 3-5 local sayings for each region that reflect their history or environment (e.g., "May your path be shaded" in a desert).
- **Economic Logic:** What does this town produce? Why is it located here? (Near a river for trade, near a mine for resources, etc.)

## The "Why" of Magic
- **Source:** Where does magic come from? Is it a limited resource (like oil)? Is it part of the atmosphere? Is it a gift from gods?
- **Cost:** What is the physical or mental price of using magic?
- **Societal Impact:** How has magic changed the world? Is it used for industrial purposes? Is it feared and outlawed? Does it replace technology or augment it?

## Dynamic NPC Dialogue Patterns
- **The Context Shift:** NPC dialogue should change after major events.
- **The "Flavor" NPC:** NPCs that exist purely to comment on world events or local gossip, rather than giving quests.
- **The Contrarian:** For every major world event, there should be an NPC who disagrees with the popular opinion.
