# Lore Writer

This skill guides you in creating deep, organic lore that feels lived-in and unique.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Define the Goal
Are you writing a character backstory, a town history, a quest narrative, or a mythological fragment?

### 2. Consult the Principles
Read [references/principles.md](references/principles.md) to ensure your writing avoids generic tropes and uses "Show, Don't Tell" techniques.

### 3. Apply Frameworks
- For characters: See [references/archetypes.md](references/archetypes.md).
- For world/locations: See [references/world-building.md](references/world-building.md).

### 4. Drafting
When drafting, focus on:
- **Sensory Detail:** Specific smells, sounds, and textures.
- **The "Why":** Every element should have a historical or functional reason for being.
- **Distinct Voices:** Ensure characters don't all sound the same.

## Output Formats

### Lore Fragment (Myth/History)
```markdown
## [Title of Fragment]
[Text of the myth or history, written in a specific tone—e.g., scholarly, poetic, or folk-tale.]
**Historical Context:** [The "real" events this myth is based on.]
**Game Integration:** [How this lore appears in-game—e.g., an inscription, an NPC's story, an item description.]
```

### NPC Profile
```markdown
### [NPC Name]
**Archetype & Twist:** [See archetypes.md]
**Internal Conflict:** [Desire A vs. Desire B]
**Speech Pattern:** [Unique vocabulary or quirks]
**Key Dialogue Lines:**
1. [Line reflecting their personality]
2. [Line reflecting their reaction to world events]
```

### Location "Why"
```markdown
## [Location Name]
**Purpose:** [Original purpose of the location]
**Current State:** [How and why it changed]
**Environmental Storytelling:** [3 specific details the player can see that tell its story]
```
