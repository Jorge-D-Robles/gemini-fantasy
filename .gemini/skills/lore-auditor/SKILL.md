# Lore Auditor

This skill helps you identify and fix generic or formulaic writing in your game's lore.

## Audit Workflow

### 1. Identify Target
Select a piece of lore, a character profile, or a dialogue script to audit.

### 2. Check for Tropes
Consult [references/tropes-to-avoid.md](references/tropes-to-avoid.md). Flag any instance of:
- Generic adjectives (epic, ancient, etc.)
- Expository "Encyclopedia" tone
- Perfect morality or lacks of motivation
- Floating locations without historical context
- Circular or repetitive dialogue

### 3. Evaluate "Show, Don't Tell"
Check if the writing is *explaining* a feeling or event rather than *showing* it through detail or character reaction.

### 4. Propose Improvements
For every flagged issue, suggest a concrete change based on the principles in the `lore-writer` skill.
