# Tropes and "AI-isms" to Avoid

When auditing lore, look for these common pitfalls that make writing feel generic or "AI-generated."

## 1. Generic Adjectives
- **Avoid:** "Epic," "ancient," "mysterious," "legendary," "dark," "powerful."
- **Why:** They are filler words that don't paint a picture.
- **Fix:** Replace with concrete descriptions (e.g., "chipped obsidian," "smelling of ozone and old parchment").

## 2. Perfect Morality
- **Avoid:** Entire races that are "evil" or "good," heroes who never struggle with their choices, villains who are "evil for the sake of evil."
- **Fix:** Give everyone a logical motivation. Create "Gray" areas where both sides have a point.

## 3. The "Encyclopedia" Tone
- **Avoid:** Flat, expository writing that reads like a Wikipedia entry.
- **Fix:** Write from a specific perspective. A scholar's history will be different from a peasant's folk tale or a soldier's war story.

## 4. Floating Locations
- **Avoid:** Towns or dungeons that have no connection to the surrounding geography or history.
- **Fix:** Ask "What do they eat?", "Where does their water come from?", "Who did they fight 50 years ago?"

## 5. Convenient Magic
- **Avoid:** Magic that solves every plot problem without cost or explanation.
- **Fix:** Define the rules and the price of magic. Let characters fail because the magic wasn't enough or the cost was too high.

## 6. Circular Dialogue
- **Avoid:** Characters who just agree with each other or repeat what was just said ("So you're saying the king is dead?" "Yes, the king is dead.").
- **Fix:** Give characters conflicting goals or different levels of information. Let them be wrong, stubborn, or secretive.

## 7. Over-Explanation
- **Avoid:** Explaining every mystery immediately.
- **Fix:** Leave gaps. Let the player wonder. Some things should remain legends.
