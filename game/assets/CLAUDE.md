# game/assets/

Game art assets. **PNGs and audio files are gitignored** — they exist on disk but are not committed. Only `.import` sidecar files (generated by Godot) are tracked in git.

## Directory Structure

```
assets/
  tilesets/                    # A5, A1, A2, B tile sheets (16x16 px) — 60+ files
  sprites/
    characters/                # Player + NPC walk sprites (RPG Maker format: 3 col x 4 row)
      battle/                  # Side-view battle sprites (kael, iris, garrick, beast heroes)
    enemies/                   # Enemy/boss sprites for overworld + battle (26 files)
    buildings/                 # Standalone building/structure Sprite2D assets (hut, lodge, trees)
    animals/                   # Animal walk sprites (dogs, cats, birds, horse) + shadowless
    misc/                      # Ships, mini-chars, dungeon props, effects (34 files)
  portraits/                   # Character face portraits for dialogue (16 files)
  icons/                       # Item/ability icon sheets — 24px, 32px, halloween (3 files)
```

> **Note:** `audio/` (bgm/, sfx/) is not yet present but belongs here when added.

## Source Assets

All art comes from Time Fantasy packs at `/Users/robles/repos/games/assets/`. **Never generate placeholder art.** See `assets/CLAUDE.md` (repo root) for the full pack index, per-file inventory, and region-to-pack mapping.

## Copy Workflow

Assets must live in **both** the main repo and the active worktree:

```bash
# Copy to main repo (required — Godot runs from here)
cp <source> /Users/robles/repos/games/gemini-fantasy/game/assets/<subdir>/<name>.png

# Copy to current worktree
cp <source> /Users/robles/repos/games/gemini-fantasy/.worktrees/<branch>/game/assets/<subdir>/<name>.png
```

Or use the `/copy-assets` skill which automates both steps.

After copying, **reopen the Godot editor** to trigger `.import` file generation. Without import files, `load()` returns `null`.

## Gitignore Rules

`.png`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.mp3` under `game/assets/` are all gitignored. Only `.import` sidecar files are committed (generated by Godot on first open).

## Loading Assets in GDScript

Always null-check after `load()` — a missing import file causes silent null returns:

```gdscript
var tex: Texture2D = load("res://assets/sprites/enemies/ghost1.png") as Texture2D
if tex == null:
    push_error("Failed to load texture — reopen Godot to import")
    return
```

## Tile Sheet Reference

| Sheet Type | Prefix | Dimensions | Tile Size | Use For |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| A5 | `tf_A5_*`, `tf_ff_tileA5_*` | 128x256 | 16x16 | Ground terrain fills (8 col x 16 row) |
| A1 | `tf_A1_*` | varies | 16x16 | Animated water/lava autotiles |
| A2 | `tf_A2_*` | varies | 16x16 | Ground autotiles with transitions |
| B | `tf_B_*`, `tf_ff_tileB_*` | 256x256 | 16x16 | Objects: trees, rocks, buildings (16 col x 16 row) |

- **Ground layers**: use one A5 column per terrain patch — mixing columns creates checkerboard artifacts
- **Object layers**: B-sheet tiles; pass correct `source_id` to `MapBuilder.build_layer()`
- **MapBuilder constants**: all imported A5/B tilesets have named constants in `game/systems/map_builder.gd`
- See `docs/best-practices/11-tilemaps-and-level-design.md` for full tilemap conventions
