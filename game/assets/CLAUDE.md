# game/assets/

Game art assets. **PNGs and audio files are gitignored** — they exist on disk but are not committed.

## Directory Structure

```
assets/
  tilesets/                    # TileA5 and TileB tile sheets (16×16 px)
  sprites/
    characters/                # Player + NPC walk sprites (3 col × 4 row sheets)
      battle/                  # Side-view battle sprites
    buildings/                 # Building/structure sprites
    enemies/                   # Enemy walk sprites for overworld + battle
  portraits/                   # Character face portraits for dialogue
```

> **Note:** `audio/` (bgm/, sfx/) is not yet present but belongs here when added.

## Source Assets

All art comes from Time Fantasy packs at `/Users/robles/repos/games/assets/`. **Never generate placeholder art.** See `assets/CLAUDE.md` (repo root) for the full pack index and format notes.

## Copy Workflow

Assets must live in **both** the main repo and the active worktree:

```bash
# Copy to main repo (required — Godot runs from here)
cp <source> /Users/robles/repos/games/gemini-fantasy/game/assets/<subdir>/<name>.png

# Copy to current worktree
cp <source> /Users/robles/repos/games/gemini-fantasy/.worktrees/<branch>/game/assets/<subdir>/<name>.png
```

Or use the `/copy-assets` skill which automates both steps.

After copying, **reopen the Godot editor** to trigger `.import` file generation. Without import files, `load()` returns `null`.

## Gitignore Rules

`.png`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.mp3` under `game/assets/` are all gitignored. Only `.import` sidecar files are committed (generated by Godot on first open).

## Loading Assets in GDScript

Always null-check after `load()` — a missing import file causes silent null returns:

```gdscript
var tex: Texture2D = load("res://assets/sprites/enemies/ghost.png") as Texture2D
if tex == null:
    push_error("Failed to load texture — reopen Godot to import")
    return
```

## Tile Sheet Reference

| Sheet type | Dimensions | Tile size | Use for |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| A5 | 128×256 | 16×16 | Ground terrain fills |
| B | 256×256 | 16×16 | Objects: trees, rocks, buildings |

- **Ground layers**: one consistent A5 tile per layer — do not alternate columns (creates checkerboard)
- **Object layers**: B-sheet tiles; pass correct `source_id` to `MapBuilder.build_layer()`
- See `docs/best-practices/11-tilemaps-and-level-design.md` for full tilemap conventions
